The root systems were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen Plants were grown for 14 days in the 16/8 hours light/dark at 21 degrees celsius. After 14 days plants were transferred to the dark for the remaining time until sampling. Plants were grown in 6 wells plates with MS-20 medium with Gelrite. The Maxwell® 16 Tissue LEV plant RNA kit was used for mRNA isolation with a Maxwell® AS2000 instrument (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After the total RNA extraction and DNase I treatment, magnetic beads with Oligo (dT) are used to isolate mRNA. Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA is fragmented into short fragments. Then cDNA is synthesized using the mRNA fragments as templates. Short fragments are purified and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. After that, the short fragments are connected with adapters. The suitable fragments are size-selected for the PCR amplification as templates.

Then cDNA is synthesized using the mRNA fragments as templates. Short fragments are purified and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. After that, the short fragments are connected with adapters. The suitable fragments are size-selected for the PCR amplification as templates. During the QC steps, Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System are used in quantification and qualification of the sample library.	db34c6d2e0285a2b8f08b0b8e0d7c8a4;63319d96be25b73b7dde595e83bd0a7f	2578206927;2548592039	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR939/004/ERR9390324/ERR9390324_2.fastq.gz
