Plants were grown for 1 week in a growth chamber (200 μEm-2s-1, 23°C, 16 h light, 70% relative humidity). Seeds were sterilized by 2 min incubation with 12% sodiumhypochloride (Roth, Germany) and sown on UV-sterilized hardware. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system, called ARADISH (Schuler et al., 2015), on stainless steel meshes with water, but without media. Seeds were sown within a one cm radius with respect to the center of the dish and the center of clinorotation and ARADISHES were placed in a phytochamber (Binder). A. thaliana seedlings, grown on ARADISH were either exposed to 5 to 600 minutes of 2D clinorotation at 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 21 °C in the dark on a custom-built clinostat (DLR, Cologne, Germany) or kept in darkness and used as a contol. After exposure the roots were harvested in liquid nitrogen.  RNA was extracted from 100 mg root tissue per replicate using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  rRNA removal was performed with the Ribo-Zero Plant rRNA removal kit (Illumina) for plant seeds and roots according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA LT kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.	9206f223fa46a9d93a0b4411d6fbfe28	648675876	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/007/ERR1474947/ERR1474947.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/007/ERR1474947/ERR1474947.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR147/007/ERR1474947/ERR1474947.fastq.gz

Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system, called ARADISH (Schuler et al., 2015), on stainless steel meshes with water, but without media. Seeds were sown within a one cm radius with respect to the center of the dish and the center of clinorotation and ARADISHES were placed in a phytochamber (Binder). A. thaliana seedlings, grown on ARADISH were either exposed to 5 to 600 minutes of 2D clinorotation at 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 21 °C in the dark on a custom-built clinostat (DLR, Cologne, Germany) or kept in darkness and used as a contol. After exposure the roots were harvested in liquid nitrogen.  RNA was extracted from 100 mg root tissue per replicate using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  rRNA removal was performed with the Ribo-Zero Plant rRNA removal kit (Illumina) for plant seeds and roots according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA LT kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.	795c12e7285cbf6aa712befdd3c3b946	461738462	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474966/ERR1474966.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474966/ERR1474966.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474966/ERR1474966.fastq.gz

Plants were grown for 1 week in a growth chamber (200 μEm-2s-1, 23°C, 16 h light, 70% relative humidity). Seeds were sterilized by 2 min incubation with 12% sodiumhypochloride (Roth, Germany) and sown on UV-sterilized hardware. Seedlings were grown in a hydroponic system, called ARADISH (Schuler et al., 2015), on stainless steel meshes with water, but without media. Seeds were sown within a one cm radius with respect to the center of the dish and the center of clinorotation and ARADISHES were placed in a phytochamber (Binder). A. thaliana seedlings, grown on ARADISH were either exposed to 5 to 600 minutes of 2D clinorotation at 60 revolutions per minute (rpm) and 21 °C in the dark on a custom-built clinostat (DLR, Cologne, Germany) or kept in darkness and used as a contol. After exposure the roots were harvested in liquid nitrogen.  RNA was extracted from 100 mg root tissue per replicate using an RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN) according to the manufacturer&apos;s instructions.  rRNA removal was performed with the Ribo-Zero Plant rRNA removal kit (Illumina) for plant seeds and roots according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA library preparation was performed using the Illumina TruSeq® Stranded Total RNA LT kit following the manufacturer’s protocol.	9648f8df7ddcfe9e8e786ba0cf6f751a	590610364	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474976/ERR1474976.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474976/ERR1474976.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR147/006/ERR1474976/ERR1474976.fastq.gz
