Seeds of the different genotypes were sown on a soil mixture containing peat moss (40%), vermiculite (50%) and perlite (10%), and stratified in the dark at 4°C for 2-3 days. Plants were grown at 20–22℃ under 12-hour light/ 12-hour dark photoperiod cycles. Leaf-infiltration with 1-ml needless syringe Total RNA was extracted using TriZol (Thermo Fisher) and further purified using RNeasy kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Libraries were prepared using the MGIEasy RNA Library Prep kit (MGI Tech) according to manufacturer’s instructions	77d0e34279004db879f4d3a7c6a3c635;ed000cd2ed6cca2d859638eec0520fb2	3301336791;3289187523	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR984/008/ERR9847088/ERR9847088_2.fastq.gz
