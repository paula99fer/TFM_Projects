Seeds of A. thaliana cv Col-0 were sown on peat Jyffy discs and kept in the dark at room temperature for three days. When plants reached 2 cm of total length, they were transferred in soil for 15 days and then in hydroponic culture (one plant per 500-mL pot containing Hoagland solution, (Hoagland &amp; Arnon, 1950)) in a growth chamber (25°C for 16 hours of light at 120 µmol m-2s-1 and 22°C for 8 hours of dark, 60% of relative humidity). Plants were maintained one week in acclimation before the application of the stress. Chromium treatments (Cr(VI) supplied as K2Cr2O7) were the following: 1) 2.5 µM Cr (VI) until harvest after nine weeks of growth (chronic stress) and 5 µM Cr (VI) for three weeks and then recovering in Cr-free Hoagland solution until harvest. Five plants (biological replicates) were used for each of these stress conditions in addition to five control plants (grown in Hoagland in absence of Cr stress).  Leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. RNA extraction was performed using 100 mg of leaves grounded with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen.

Seeds of A. thaliana cv Col-0 were sown on peat Jyffy discs and kept in the dark at room temperature for three days. When plants reached 2 cm of total length, they were transferred in soil for 15 days and then in hydroponic culture (one plant per 500-mL pot containing Hoagland solution, (Hoagland &amp; Arnon, 1950)) in a growth chamber (25°C for 16 hours of light at 120 µmol m-2s-1 and 22°C for 8 hours of dark, 60% of relative humidity). Plants were maintained one week in acclimation before the application of the stress. Chromium treatments (Cr(VI) supplied as K2Cr2O7) were the following: 1) 2.5 µM Cr (VI) until harvest after nine weeks of growth (chronic stress) and 5 µM Cr (VI) for three weeks and then recovering in Cr-free Hoagland solution until harvest. Five plants (biological replicates) were used for each of these stress conditions in addition to five control plants (grown in Hoagland in absence of Cr stress).  Leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. RNA extraction was performed using 100 mg of leaves grounded with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen.

Seeds of A. thaliana cv Col-0 were sown on peat Jyffy discs and kept in the dark at room temperature for three days. When plants reached 2 cm of total length, they were transferred in soil for 15 days and then in hydroponic culture (one plant per 500-mL pot containing Hoagland solution, (Hoagland &amp; Arnon, 1950)) in a growth chamber (25°C for 16 hours of light at 120 µmol m-2s-1 and 22°C for 8 hours of dark, 60% of relative humidity). Plants were maintained one week in acclimation before the application of the stress. Chromium treatments (Cr(VI) supplied as K2Cr2O7) were the following: 1) 2.5 µM Cr (VI) until harvest after nine weeks of growth (chronic stress) and 5 µM Cr (VI) for three weeks and then recovering in Cr-free Hoagland solution until harvest. Five plants (biological replicates) were used for each of these stress conditions in addition to five control plants (grown in Hoagland in absence of Cr stress).  Leaves were immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. RNA extraction was performed using 100 mg of leaves grounded with mortar and pestle in liquid nitrogen. The protocol of RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) was followed and final elutions were performed using 50 µl of RNase-free water.
