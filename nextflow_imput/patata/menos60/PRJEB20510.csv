After two days of stratification at 4 °C plates were transferred to growth chambers (Rumed, Rubarth Apparate GmbH) with a photoperiod of 16 h 22 °C: 8 h 18 °C, light : dark at 120-150 μmol m-2s-1 light intensity. Total RNA was extracted from approximately 75-100 mg mg frozen plant material with the SV Total RNA Isolation System (Promega Corporation, Madison, WI, USA).
