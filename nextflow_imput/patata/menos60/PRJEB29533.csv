Seedlings were placed in 6-well plates and immersed in 10 ml of water or 0.5 mM SA.  1) Grind tissue very fine in liquid nitrogen. 2) Add 0.5 ml RNA extraction buffer (warmed to ~80ºC) and 0.5 ml phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol mixture (25:24:1). Vortex vigorously. 3) Centrifuge max. speed for 5 min. at 4ºC, but do not put samples on ice. 4) Transfer the aqueous phase (upper phase) to a new tube. 5) Add 0.5 ml cold chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) and vortex vigorously. 6) Centrifuge max. speed for 5 min. at 4ºC, but do not put samples on ice. 7) Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6. 8)Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube on ice and add 1/3 volume of 8 M LiCl.  9) Incubate overnight at 4ºC. 10) Centrifuge max. speed for 15 min. at 4ºC. A small clear pellet of total RNA should  be visible.
