Illumina HiSeq 4000 paired end sequencing; RNA-seq of a time series experiment of leaf 3 tissue (primordia / leaf blade) of Arabidopsis plants grown under EoD FR since day 6, since day 18 or under WL conditions.	Protocols: Samples were collected at ZT22-23 into a falcon tube with RNA later solution. Once all samples were collected, L3 primordias and L3 blades were dissected with a scalpel, in a Petri dish filled with RNA later solution, under a Leica MZ 16 F dissecting microscope. Seeds were stratified in a 0.1% Agar solution, in darkness for 5 days at 4°C. Seeds were then sown on F2 + S Levington Advance Seed and Modular Compost plus Sand soil mix (ICL Specialty Fertilizers, Suffolk, U.K.) and grown inside a Percival SE-41L cabinet (CLF Plant Climatics, Wertingen, Germany) under a light : dark (LD) 12 h : 12 h photoperiod, at a 100 µmoles/m2/s fluence rate and 21 °C of constant temperature. On the 6th day, plants were thinned to a density of 1-2 plants per pot. Specific details on growth conditions are mentioned in the respective figure legends.

RNA-seq of a time series experiment of leaf 3 tissue (primordia / leaf blade) of Arabidopsis plants grown under EoD FR since day 6, since day 18 or under WL conditions.	Illumina HiSeq 4000 paired end sequencing; RNA-seq of a time series experiment of leaf 3 tissue (primordia / leaf blade) of Arabidopsis plants grown under EoD FR since day 6, since day 18 or under WL conditions.	Protocols: Samples were collected at ZT22-23 into a falcon tube with RNA later solution. Once all samples were collected, L3 primordias and L3 blades were dissected with a scalpel, in a Petri dish filled with RNA later solution, under a Leica MZ 16 F dissecting microscope. Seeds were stratified in a 0.1% Agar solution, in darkness for 5 days at 4°C. Seeds were then sown on F2 + S Levington Advance Seed and Modular Compost plus Sand soil mix (ICL Specialty Fertilizers, Suffolk, U.K.) and grown inside a Percival SE-41L cabinet (CLF Plant Climatics, Wertingen, Germany) under a light : dark (LD) 12 h : 12 h photoperiod, at a 100 µmoles/m2/s fluence rate and 21 °C of constant temperature. On the 6th day, plants were thinned to a density of 1-2 plants per pot. Specific details on growth conditions are mentioned in the respective figure legends. Unless otherwise mentioned, Polylux XLR FT8/18W/835 fluorescent tubes (GE) were used as a white light (WL) light source. For End of Day (EoD) Far-red (FR) treatments, we custom modified the bottom shelf of a Percival cabinet and mounted 7 24V OSLON 150 ILS-OW06-FRED-SD111 FR led strips (Intelligent Led Solutions, Berkshire, UK), to deliver 40µmoles/m2/s of FR light (730nm) for 10 minutes.
