Total RNAs were isolated from the calli of wild type Col-0 and the mutant dcc1 with TRI reagent (Sigma, catalog number T9424). The mRNA was enriched by Ribo-ZeroTM Magnetic Kit (Epicentre), and fragmented into short fragments using fragmentation buffer and reverse transcripted into cDNA with random primers. Second-strand cDNA were synthesized by DNA polymerase I. Then the cDNA fragments were purified with QiaQuick PCR extraction kit, end repaired, poly(A) added, and ligated to Illumina sequencing adapters. The ligation products were size selected by agarose gel electrophoresis, and amplified by PCR to construct the RNA-seq llibraries.	132b40d4831ea5f68443423e8d8b794f;394ffde4f041812f72d92413078c32be	1723386898;2047021427	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR172/009/ERR1727059/ERR1727059_2.fastq.gz
