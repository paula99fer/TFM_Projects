In total, three biological replicates were performed. the third leaf was harvested by micro-dissecting, then pooled and flash frozen in liquid nitrogen. For the experiment of MD treatment in soil, seeds were sown in pots, which were filled up to 85 g ± 0.5 g of Saniflor soil (Van Isreal N.V., Geraardsbergen, Belgium) with an absolute water content of on average 70%. After 5 nights of stratification at 4°C in darkness, the pots were moved to a growth chamber (21°C and 16-h day/8-h night cycles). At 4 DAS, the pots were transferred to the automated phenotyping platform WIWAM (21°C and 16-h day/8-h night cycles) and randomized to homogenously mix the natural accessions and treatments. The controlled MD treatment was initiated at 6 DAS. Control-treatment pots were kept at 2.2 gwater/gsoil.
