Seeds of the Landsberg erecta (Ler) accession of Arabidopsis thaliana (L) Heyhn, were surface sterilized for 3 min with a solution of 10 mL of 70% ethanol and 10 ul Tween 20, followed by five times wash in distilled water. Seeds were given a quick rinse in 96% ethanol before air drying on a sterile filter paper inside a sterile hood.

The seeds were then germinated for 6 days at 20°C under a photon flux density of 30 μmol m-2 s-1 at 400-700 nm (TL-D 58W/840 lamps, Phillips) in a 16 h photoperiod.

Seeds were given a quick rinse in 96% ethanol before air drying on a sterile filter paper inside a sterile hood. All seeds were evenly sown on 1/2 MS medium (Murashige &amp; Skoog 1962; Duchefa Biochemie, Harleem, Netherland) with 0.8% agar (Plant agar, Sigma-Aldrich) in  petri dishes of 5 cm diameter. The seeds were then germinated for 6 days at 20°C under a photon flux density of 30 μmol m-2 s-1 at 400-700 nm (TL-D 58W/840 lamps, Phillips) in a 16 h photoperiod. Six days old seedlings were exposed to gamma radiation for 48h at gamma dose rates 1, 10, 40, 100, or 290 mGy/h, using the FIGARO low dose gamma irradiation facility (60Co; 1173.2 and 1332.5 keV γ-rays) at Norwegian University of Life Sciences (Hansen et al. 2019). During the gamma irradiation, the room temperature was set at 20˚C±1°C with a 12 h photoperiod with a photon flux density of 55 μmol m-2 s-1 provided by high pressure metal halide lamps (HPI-T Plus 250W lamps, Phillips).
