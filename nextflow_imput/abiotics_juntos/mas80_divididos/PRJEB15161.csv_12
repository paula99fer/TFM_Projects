RNAlater®-ICE (Ambion®), which prevents RNA from degrading, was cooled at -70°C, added to the samples and was allowed to penetrate the tissue at -20°C for 5 days. The third leaf was collected by microdissection under a microscope. Samples were microdissected in a Petri dish on dry ice to keep the samples below room temperature. Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh accessions were grown in a growth chamber under controlled environmental conditions (21°C, 55% relative humidity, 16¬ h day/ 8 h night, 110-120 μmol m-2 s-1 light intensity). Plants were germinated in soil-filled 96-well plates after four days of stratification at 4°C in the dark. Seedlings were transferred to pots at four days after stratification (DAS). Average-sized seedlings were selected using an in-house developed image algorithm in order to reduce seedling size effects at the beginning of the experiment. Before transfer, the relative water content of the pots was set at 1.2 g H2O/g dry soil for the mild drought treatment, the control condition was set at 2.2 g H2O/g dry soil. Once the seedlings were transferred to pots, they were placed on the automated phenotyping platform WIWAM (Skirycz et al., 2011b). The water content of the soil was kept constant until 10 DAS, after which it was lowered daily to target 0.7 g H2O/g dry soil for the mild drought treated plants (Fig. 1D).
