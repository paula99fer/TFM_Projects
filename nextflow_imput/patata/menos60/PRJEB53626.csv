Root samples harvested from two independent grafting experiments were subjected to RNA-Seq analysis. Roots from four plants in each experiment were pooled as one biological replicate. Seeds were placed in the dark at 4˚C for 3 days to break dormancy. Seedlings were grown vertically under a PPFD of 25 µmol m−2 s−1 (16/8-h light/dark cycle) at 22˚C. Micrografting was performed aseptically using 5-day-old seedlings, which were cut perpendicularly in the hypocotyl with an injection needle tip. The obtained scion was connected with the partner rootstock in a silicon microtube. The grafted plants were incubated for 5 days under a PPDF of 50 µmol m−2 s−1 (constant light) at 27˚C and further cultivated for 1 day under a PPFD of 25 µmol m−2 s−1 (16/8-h light/dark cycle) at 22˚C. The grafted plants were horizontally grown for 7 days under a PPFD of 100–120 µmol m−2 s−1 (16/8-h light/dark cycle) at 22˚C –23˚C in 30 mL of 1/2-Murashige and Skoog (MS) or 1/50-MS salts without vitamins supplemented with 0.05% (w/v) MES-KOH (pH 5.7), 1% (w/v) sucrose, and 0.8% (w/v) purified agar.
