Sample homogenizing was done by adding one half of TRI-Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich, 1ml per 100mg) to each sample following sample disruption by using Precellys 24 Lysis &amp; Homogenization instrument for 30sec and 4000rpm. After homogenization total-RNA was extracted by adding 2nd half of TRI-Reagent and the protocol was proceeded according to the manufacture. To remove any co-precipitated DNA, a DNase-I digest was performed by using 1U DNase-I (NEB) in a total Volume of 100ul. Total-RNA was cleaned-up by LiCL-Precipitation using 10µl 8M LiCL and 3Vol 100% Ethanol pa. incubating at -20°C over-night. Following a spin down at 4°C, 13.000rpm for 30min and 2 washing steps with 70% Ethanol pa. The RNA pellet was dried on ice for 1h and resuspended in 40ul DEPC-H2O incubating at 56°C for 5min. The quality of total-RNA was checked by Agilent TapeStation using RNA ScreenTape. Concentration was measured with Qubit RNA BR Assay Kit from Thermo Fisher Scientific.	ddffc907cfe2bba591976f3d70bfaa19;1f56aa036c46b1d47036923d46aaa1ed	2948513571;2992456137	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR419/001/ERR4192131/ERR4192131_2.fastq.gz
