Microspores and developing pollen grains were released from anthers of closed flower buds and purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described (Dupláková et al., 2016; Honys and Twell, 2004). Populations of spores at five stages of development were isolated: uninucleate microspores (UNM), bicellular pollen (BCP), late bicellular pollen (LBC), tricellular pollen (TCP) and mature pollen (MPG).  For semi in vivo pollen tube growth, a transgenic marker line harboring MGH3p::MGH3-eGFP and ACT11p::H2B-mRFP (Borges et al. 2012) was used to pollinate WT emasculated pistils. After 2 hours, the pollinated pistil was excised and placed on double sided tape. The excised pistil was then cut at the junction of style and ovary and placed gently on solidified agarose pollen germination medium (Boavida and McCormick, 2007). The pistil was incubated for an additional 4 hours for the pollen tubes to emerge from the cut end of the style. The pollen tubes were harvested using 25G needle and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently used for the RNA-seq library preparation as described in Misra et al., 2019.

For semi in vivo pollen tube growth, a transgenic marker line harboring MGH3p::MGH3-eGFP and ACT11p::H2B-mRFP (Borges et al. 2012) was used to pollinate WT emasculated pistils. After 2 hours, the pollinated pistil was excised and placed on double sided tape. The excised pistil was then cut at the junction of style and ovary and placed gently on solidified agarose pollen germination medium (Boavida and McCormick, 2007). The pistil was incubated for an additional 4 hours for the pollen tubes to emerge from the cut end of the style. The pollen tubes were harvested using 25G needle and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently used for the RNA-seq library preparation as described in Misra et al., 2019.

Microspores and developing pollen grains were released from anthers of closed flower buds and purified by Percoll density gradient centrifugation as described (Dupláková et al., 2016; Honys and Twell, 2004). Populations of spores at five stages of development were isolated: uninucleate microspores (UNM), bicellular pollen (BCP), late bicellular pollen (LBC), tricellular pollen (TCP) and mature pollen (MPG).  For semi in vivo pollen tube growth, a transgenic marker line harboring MGH3p::MGH3-eGFP and ACT11p::H2B-mRFP (Borges et al. 2012) was used to pollinate WT emasculated pistils. After 2 hours, the pollinated pistil was excised and placed on double sided tape. The excised pistil was then cut at the junction of style and ovary and placed gently on solidified agarose pollen germination medium (Boavida and McCormick, 2007). The pistil was incubated for an additional 4 hours for the pollen tubes to emerge from the cut end of the style. The pollen tubes were harvested using 25G needle and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen and subsequently used for the RNA-seq library preparation as described in Misra et al., 2019.
