L. bicolor was grown from culture on cellophane and P20 medium for 14 days at 22 °C in darkness. Per bi-compartmented squared Petri dish, 15 4-days-old A. thaliana seedlings were co-incubated with 4 14-days-old L. bicolor plugs. Control seedlings were grown with cellophane and P20. Arabidopsis RNA was extracted using RNAeasy extraction kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer&apos;s protocol. Poly-A RNA was enriched using the NEBNext Poly (A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module (New England Biolabs (NEB), Ipswich, Massachusetts, USA). Sequencing libraries were prepared using the NEBNext Ultra RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina (NEB) according to manufacturer’s instructions.	03ed42c58eeebdbbf8ae6c4700cbadaa	919668706	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR382/009/ERR3822159/ERR3822159.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR382/009/ERR3822159/ERR3822159.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR382/009/ERR3822159/ERR3822159.fastq.gz
