In brief, polyA containing mRNA molecules are reverse transcribed, double-stranded cDNA is generated and adapters are ligated.	16315f9927a2e5cd288b7551de5a1d9e;28cc89be4014d03f20a7da0c9a35e189	1181849115;1199656960	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR129/003/ERR1295193/ERR1295193_2.fastq.gz
