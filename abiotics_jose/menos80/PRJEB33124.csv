Seeds were stratified for 72 hours at 4°C and grown under long day conditions (21°C, 70% humidity, 16/8 light/dark cycle) in 100 ml liquid media containing 0.5xMurashi-Skoog basal salt, 0.5% sucrose, 1% M.E.S. monohydrate, pH 5.8 (KOH) with shaking (120 rpm). Ten days-old seedlings were treated with 150 mM NaCl in 0.1xMS media (salt stress) or 0.1xMS media (control) for time indicated separately per experiment. Seedlings were dried with paper towel and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen.  100 mg of tissue was ground and total RNA was extracted using Plant RNA extraction kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions RNA quality determination, library preparation and sequencing with Illumina HiSeq 2500 was performed by Eurofins Genomics (Germany).	45b37752882a4a71a21c540ee40460e5	909145247	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR338/005/ERR3385355/ERR3385355.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR338/005/ERR3385355/ERR3385355.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR338/005/ERR3385355/ERR3385355.fastq.gz
