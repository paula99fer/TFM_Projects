Additionally, the same number of leaves of plants grown in moderate light and elevated CO2 was harvested and served as controls. This entire setup was repeated twice to obtain three biological repeats of each time-point analysed per genotype.  Catalase knock-out (cat2-2) and wild-type (WT) Arabidopsis thaliana plants, ecotype Columbia-0 (Col-0), were grown under elevated CO2 concentrations (3,000 ppm) to impair photorespiration. Individual plants were organized according to a completely randomized block design in a controlled climate chamber (Votsch Industrietechnik) in a 12 h day/12 h night regime (relative humidity of 50%, 21°C and an irradiance of 100 μmol m-2 s-1).  For high light (HL) treatments, 5 week-old plants were transferred to a Sanyo Fitotron plant growth chamber at dawn in ambient air conditions (400 ppm CO2, relative humidity of 55%, 21°C) and continuous HL irradiation of 1,200 μmol m-2 s-1 for 1, 2 or 3 hours.  600 μl supernatant was used for the isolation of ribosome-protected footprints.  Digestion of non-protected mRNA was done by adding 1000 U of RNaseI (Thermo Fisher Scientific) followed by incubation for 55 min with gentle agitation (400 rpm) at 25°C (Thermoblock). This reaction was stopped by adding 600 U of SUPERase•InTM RNase Inhibitor (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and the reaction mixture loaded on top of a 1 M sucrose cushion in...	14de9e834d579163d8a57601b67cd50e	1144942339	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR143/009/ERR1433119/ERR1433119.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR143/009/ERR1433119/ERR1433119.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR143/009/ERR1433119/ERR1433119.fastq.gz
