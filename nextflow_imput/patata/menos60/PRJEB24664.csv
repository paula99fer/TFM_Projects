True-Seq kit (Illumina Inc.) was used to prepare RNA-seq libraries, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.	56bebd72b97efcd36746b1aea937518f;a06504367515ae4ade16c73c2242a194	900660113;931378830	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR227/003/ERR2273083/ERR2273083_2.fastq.gz
