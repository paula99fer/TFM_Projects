In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained within each SAR set. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil, vermiculite and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h day (9 AM to 7 PM; photon flux density 100 mol m-2 s-1) / 14-h night cycle and a relative humidity of 70 %. Day and night temperatures were set to 21C and 18C, respectively. Experiments were performed with 5- to 6-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance. To activate SAR, plants were infiltrated between 10 AM and 12 AM into three lower (1) leaves with suspensions of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (OD600 = 0.005). Infiltration with 10 mM MgCl2 served as the mock-control treatment. Upper (2) leaves were harvested 48 h after the primary treatment for the determination of systemic gene expression by RNA-seq analyses. Three biologically independent, replicate SAR induction experiments were performed with Col-0 and sid2 plants. RNA was extracted from leaf sample replicates with the Plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany), and treated on-column (Qiagen, Germany) and in solution with RNA-free DNAse (New England Biolabs, MA, USA).

In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained within each SAR set. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil, vermiculite and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h day (9 AM to 7 PM; photon flux density 100 mol m-2 s-1) / 14-h night cycle and a relative humidity of 70 %. Day and night temperatures were set to 21C and 18C, respectively. Experiments were performed with 5- to 6-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance. To activate SAR, plants were infiltrated between 10 AM and 12 AM into three lower (1) leaves with suspensions of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (OD600 = 0.005). Infiltration with 10 mM MgCl2 served as the mock-control treatment. Upper (2) leaves were harvested 48 h after the primary treatment for the determination of systemic gene expression by RNA-seq analyses.
