Tissue was collected over 3 days, from 54 days after planting (DAP) to 56 DAP. The tissue collection was done at the same time of day during these three days to remove the complication of potential circadian controlled gene expression. All the plants were collected at least two weeks before bolting, therefore the plants were most likely in the vegetative stage. Each plant was harvested in liquid nitrogen as follows: (1) the central meristematic tissue was harvested as a 0.8cm diameter circular sample centered at the ...	a3247aa481ce96cb4003432bddeb61a4	43839373	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR525/SRR525227/SRR525227.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR525/SRR525227/SRR525227.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR525/SRR525227/SRR525227.fastq.gz

These inbred lines were reciprocally crossed to generate hybrids LerXCol (Col as the paternal parent and Ler as the maternal parent) and ColXLer (Ler as the paternal parent and Col as the maternal parent). Col and Ler were also manually emasculated and selfed separately to produce LerXLer (LL) and ColXCol (CC) as inbred parents in the comparisons. Seeds from all crosses were surface sterilized and planted in a soil mix (sunshine mix: perlite: vermiculite=2:1:1). They were subjected to stratification for six days at 4˚C in darkness and then allowed to germinate and grow in a growth chamber with 130uM*s-1*m-2 white light for 7 hours a day at 20˚C.
