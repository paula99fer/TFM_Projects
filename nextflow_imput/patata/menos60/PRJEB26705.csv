The Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 5% (v/v) bleach containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 10 min, washed in water, sown on half-strength Murashige Skoog (MS) medium and stratified at 4°C for 48 h. Subsequently seedlings were grown under the growth chamber conditions 16 h day/8 h night with white light and 20°C.  The poly-A containing mRNA molecules were selected and converted to cDNA using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kits. The dissected shoot apices were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized. RNA was isolated with RNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion. The manufacturer’s protocol was modified by including two additional washes of RNeasy spin columns with the RPE buffer. The library of cDNA template molecules of known strand origin was obtained using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kits.	529d6f1384af96bd3887bb81834a68d5	507863860	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR257/009/ERR2576889/ERR2576889.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR257/009/ERR2576889/ERR2576889.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR257/009/ERR2576889/ERR2576889.fastq.gz

The Arabidopsis seeds were sterilized in 5% (v/v) bleach containing 0.05% (v/v) Tween 20 for 10 min, washed in water, sown on half-strength Murashige Skoog (MS) medium and stratified at 4°C for 48 h. Subsequently seedlings were grown under the growth chamber conditions 16 h day/8 h night with white light and 20°C.  The poly-A containing mRNA molecules were selected and converted to cDNA using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kits. The dissected shoot apices were frozen in liquid nitrogen and homogenized. RNA was isolated with RNeasy Plant Kit (Qiagen) with on-column DNase digestion.
