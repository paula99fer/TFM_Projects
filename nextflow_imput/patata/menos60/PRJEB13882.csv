The growth-chamber condition was at 23°C with 65% relative humidity, and with the light at a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m−2 s−1. Total nuclear RNA was extracted from approximately 10,000 nuclei of each sample using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (Thermo Scientific).
