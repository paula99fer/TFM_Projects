Protocols: One petri-dish with approximately 20 seedlings were collected and snap frozen in liquid nitrogen MS media with 2% sucrose and stratified for 2-3 days at 4°C, then grown under long-day conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) at 22 °C and 100 μmol m-2 s-1 Sigma Spectrum Plant RNA kit, sigma on-column DNAse treatment, Turbo DNA-free kit treatment Illumina RiboZero Plant RNA library kit	f384e7e89b588ad794d2f842973100d3	837226043	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR144/002/ERR1447082/ERR1447082.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR144/002/ERR1447082/ERR1447082.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR144/002/ERR1447082/ERR1447082.fastq.gz
