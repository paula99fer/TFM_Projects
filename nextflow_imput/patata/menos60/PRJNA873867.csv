Prior to germination, seeds were stratified for 2 days at 4 °C under the dark condition and moved to growth chamber. For the heat stress treatment, plants were grown for 6 days at 22 °C (12 h light/12 h dark cycle) and then treated with heat stress of 37 °C for 24 h. Then were collected for both RNA-seq and Nanopore Direct RNA sequencing (DRS). The stress granule enrichment method was same as previous studies (Kim et al., Nature Plants, 2021; Lei et al., Bio-protocol, 2021). RNA-seq was carried out as standard methods. DRS library was prepared using direct RNA sequencing kit (Nanopore, SQK-RNA002), loaded onto an R9.4 Flow Cell (Flow cell type FLO-MIN106) and sequenced on a GridION device.	5d3e5769bcb527a823191e410ec8f345;aefe8c8ea6c9b4e36a3c360d40034986	1623338627;1646836934	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR212/086/SRR21205486/SRR21205486_2.fastq.gz
