Seeds were first germinated in agar-solidified 0.5x MS medium for 2 weeks before transfer into soil (Minitray, Balster Einheitserdewerk, Fröndenberg, DE) and a growth chamber at 12-h light(120 µmol photons m-2 s-1, 22°C) and 12-h dark (18°C; CLF Plant Climatics, Emersacker, Germany). Total RNA was isolated by RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). mRNA was enriched using oligo(dT) bead.
