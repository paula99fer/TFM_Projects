Flowers were emasculated at flower stage 12c to prevent self-pollination, and harvested at the three indicated time points. For tissue dissection, flowers were removed from the plant and placed under a standard binocular dissection microscope. With the tip of a sterile hypodermic needle, the stigma was carefully removed from the flower, while trying to minimize contamination by the underlying style tissue, and immediately flash-frozen. For each biological replicate, about 200 stigmata were pooled. RNA was extracted using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies) and RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Per sample, an amount of 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. Using the Illumina TruSeq速 Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (protocol version: Part # 15031047 Rev. D - September 2012) poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified from the total RNA input using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. In a reverse transcription reaction using random primers, RNA was converted into first strand cDNA and subsequently converted into double-stranded cDNA in a second strand cDNA synthesis reaction using DNA PolymeraseI and RNAse H.

Flowers were emasculated at flower stage 12c to prevent self-pollination, and harvested at the three indicated time points. For tissue dissection, flowers were removed from the plant and placed under a standard binocular dissection microscope. With the tip of a sterile hypodermic needle, the stigma was carefully removed from the flower, while trying to minimize contamination by the underlying style tissue, and immediately flash-frozen. For each biological replicate, about 200 stigmata were pooled. RNA was extracted using the Spectrum Plant Total RNA Kit (Sigma-Aldrich). RNA concentration and purity were determined spectrophotometrically using the Nanodrop ND-1000 (Nanodrop Technologies) and RNA integrity was assessed using a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent). Per sample, an amount of 100 ng of total RNA was used as input. Using the Illumina TruSeq速 Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit (protocol version: Part # 15031047 Rev. D - September 2012) poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified from the total RNA input using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads.
