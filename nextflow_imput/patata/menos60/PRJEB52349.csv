Plants (Col-0, tcp9, tcp20, and tcp9tcp20) were grown on modified Knop&apos;s medium for 4 days in 16/8 hours light/dark at 21 degrees Celsius. After 4 days plants were (mock) inoculated with Heterodera schachtii. Treatments ended 24, 48 or 72 hours after the start of the inoculation.

The Maxwell® 16 Tissue LEV plant RNA kit was used for mRNA isolation with a Maxwell® AS2000 instrument (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After the total RNA extraction and DNase I treatment, magnetic beads with Oligo (dT) are used to isolate mRNA. Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA is fragmented into short fragments.

Plants (Col-0, tcp9, tcp20, and tcp9tcp20) were grown on modified Knop&apos;s medium for 4 days in 16/8 hours light/dark at 21 degrees Celsius. After 4 days plants were (mock) inoculated with Heterodera schachtii. Treatments ended 24, 48 or 72 hours after the start of the inoculation. Approximately 80 plants/sample were collected and the experiment was repeated three times. The Maxwell® 16 Tissue LEV plant RNA kit was used for mRNA isolation with a Maxwell® AS2000 instrument (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After the total RNA extraction and DNase I treatment, magnetic beads with Oligo (dT) are used to isolate mRNA. Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA is fragmented into short fragments. Then cDNA is synthesized using the mRNA fragments as templates. Short fragments are purified and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. After that, the short fragments are connected with adapters. The suitable fragments are size-selected for the PCR amplification as templates.

The root systems were immediately snap frozen in liquid nitrogen. Before processing to nucleic acid extraction, root tissue was ground in liquid nitrogen. Plants (Col-0, tcp9, tcp20, and tcp9tcp20) were grown on modified Knop&apos;s medium for 4 days in 16/8 hours light/dark at 21 degrees Celsius. After 4 days plants were (mock) inoculated with Heterodera schachtii. Treatments ended 24, 48 or 72 hours after the start of the inoculation. Approximately 80 plants/sample were collected and the experiment was repeated three times. The Maxwell® 16 Tissue LEV plant RNA kit was used for mRNA isolation with a Maxwell® AS2000 instrument (Promega), following the manufacturer’s protocol. After the total RNA extraction and DNase I treatment, magnetic beads with Oligo (dT) are used to isolate mRNA. Mixed with the fragmentation buffer, the mRNA is fragmented into short fragments. Then cDNA is synthesized using the mRNA fragments as templates. Short fragments are purified and resolved with EB buffer for end reparation and single nucleotide A (adenine) addition. After that, the short fragments are connected with adapters. The suitable fragments are size-selected for the PCR amplification as templates. During the QC steps, Agilent 2100 Bioanaylzer and ABI StepOnePlus Real-Time PCR System are used in quantification and qualification of the sample library.	cc7594567084fcf5625604964d9a5d91;ff904ac46b0c708a04a560c227a73882	3159986272;3206386233	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR960/006/ERR9604316/ERR9604316_2.fastq.gz
