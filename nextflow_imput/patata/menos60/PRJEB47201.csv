For each sample, gravistimulation induced root bends with a length of 2-3mm were dissected with a scalpel from about 400 seedlings. Surface sterilized seeds were grown on sterile nylon meshes placed on top of standard ½ MS medium with 1% sucrose and 0.8% plant tissue culture agar. After 2 days of stratification at 4°C in the dark, the square petri plates were incubated vertically at 21°C in continuous light. After 4 days, seedlings were gravistimulated by turning the plates 90° counterclockwise to stimulate bending of the growing roots. 8h after gravistimulation, the nylon meshes to which the seedlings were attached were moved to ½ MS medium with 2µM estradiol or an equivalent volume of DMSO as mock treatment. 3h and 6h after treatment, root bends were collected in a centrifuge tube and frozen in liquid N2 Per sample, a 100ng of total RNA was used as input.

Surface sterilized seeds were grown on sterile nylon meshes placed on top of standard ½ MS medium with 1% sucrose and 0.8% plant tissue culture agar. After 2 days of stratification at 4°C in the dark, the square petri plates were incubated vertically at 21°C in continuous light. After 4 days, seedlings were gravistimulated by turning the plates 90° counterclockwise to stimulate bending of the growing roots. 8h after gravistimulation, the nylon meshes to which the seedlings were attached were moved to ½ MS medium with 2µM estradiol or an equivalent volume of DMSO as mock treatment. 3h and 6h after treatment, root bends were collected in a centrifuge tube and frozen in liquid N2 Per sample, a 100ng of total RNA was used as input. Using the Illumina TruSeq® Stranded mRNA Sample Prep Kit, poly-A containing mRNA molecules were purified from the total RNA input using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads. In a reverse transcription reaction using random primers, RNA was converted into first strand cDNA and subsequently converted into double-stranded cDNA in a second strand cDNA synthesis reaction using DNA PolymeraseI and RNAse H. Total RNA was extracted using the Qiagen RNeasy Plant Mini Kit in combination with on-column DNAse treat...	8d416db3632d081ef2413cac2a56c369	903383792	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR656/004/ERR6565534/ERR6565534.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR656/004/ERR6565534/ERR6565534.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR656/004/ERR6565534/ERR6565534.fastq.gz
