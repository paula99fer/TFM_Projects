Plants used in the experiment were sown onto soil in 4 inch pots and incubated for seven days in a Percival incubator set to 22°C, 45% relative humidity, under long day (16h/8h light/dark) illumination. The daily light cycle commenced at 6:00 am and ended at 10:00 pm. At 10:00 on the morning of the seventh day of growth, pots selected at random to undergo a cold stress treatment were transferred to an identically configured Percival incubator set to 4°C. Nine samples from control and cold-treated samples were collected during the next four days at 10:45 am, 1:00 pm, 4:00 pm, and 10:00 pm on the first day of treatment; 1:30 pm on the second day; 10:00 am, 5:00 pm, 9:30 pm on the third day, and 8:30 am on the fourth day.  Above-ground parts (shoots) were collected from two pots per treatment at each time point. After collection, samples were flash-frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at -80°C prior to RNA extraction. Frozen samples from all time points were pooled, RNA was extracted, and cDNA libraries were prepared for Illumina sequencing. Each library (treatment and control) was sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer for 75 cycles on two lanes per library.	b966dbb7faad0145cb3fea7c5aca4ae1	1058229984	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR976/SRR976391/SRR976391.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR976/SRR976391/SRR976391.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR976/SRR976391/SRR976391.fastq.gz
