Protocols: dissected rosette leaves incubated in dH2O at the indicated temperature for 24h Plants were grown in soil in a growth cabinet at 23°C, 50% humidity, using long day conditions (16h light, 8h dark).  Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent, precipitated with isopropanol and washed two times in ethanol 70%. Integrity was assessed by running 1ug of RNA through an agarose gel after RNA denaturation in 1X MOPS 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at 65°C. 2ug of RNA were then DNase treated using 2 unit of RQ1 DNAse (Promega) in 15ul, following manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Following DNase treatment, RNAs were further purified in phenol-chloroform.  Sequencing libraries were generated and sequenced as 50bp single-end reads at Fasteris S.A. (Geneva, Switzerland).	5eb08ff1b9763b9a6cfb2036cb811af4	1040522371	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR279/001/ERR2796341/ERR2796341.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR279/001/ERR2796341/ERR2796341.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR279/001/ERR2796341/ERR2796341.fastq.gz

Bisulfite-seq of med14-3 and WT samples in control stress.	Protocols: dissected rosette leaves incubated in dH2O at the indicated temperature for 24h Plants were grown in soil in a growth cabinet at 23°C, 50% humidity, using long day conditions (16h light, 8h dark).  Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent, precipitated with isopropanol and washed two times in ethanol 70%. Integrity was assessed by running 1ug of RNA through an agarose gel after RNA denaturation in 1X MOPS 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at 65°C. 2ug of RNA were then DNase treated using 2 unit of RQ1 DNAse (Promega) in 15ul, following manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Following DNase treatment, RNAs were further purified in phenol-chloroform.  Sequencing libraries were generated and sequenced as 50bp single-end reads at Fasteris S.A.
