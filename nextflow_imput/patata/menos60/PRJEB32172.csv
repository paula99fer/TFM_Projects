Genet.). Clean meiocytes free from somatic-cell debris were transferred to a new slide, washed with 1×PBS buffer and frozen in liquid nitrogen. ~2,000 meiotic cells were collected for each replicate.  Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under long day 16/8 hour light/dark photoperiods in a growth chamber at 21 °C and 70% humidity. Cells were lysed with lysis buffer (0.2% triton-X100 with RNase inhibitor), followed by reverse transcription using oligo-dT30VN (Sigma-Aldrich) and Superscript IV (Thermofisher).  cDNA was amplified using KAPA HiFi HotStart ReadyMix (ROCHE DIAGNOSTICS LTD) for 14 cycles before purification using Agencourt AMPure beads (Beckman Coulter). Pre-amplified libraries were quantified and quality controlled by Bioanlayzer using the High Sensitivity DNA Kit (Agilent, US). PCR amplicons were constructed into dual-indexed libraries using a Nextera XT kit (Illumina).	054e35f36ffd64dc7c7a5cd5a076df02	666970763	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR328/005/ERR3281005/ERR3281005.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR328/005/ERR3281005/ERR3281005.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR328/005/ERR3281005/ERR3281005.fastq.gz
