Three independent biological replicates were generated for each tissue/genotype combination.  For each replicate, the isolated tissue were frozen in liquid nitrogen, ground to a fine powder using a pestle and incubated for 10 minutes in 450 µl of a solution containing 2% CTAB, 100 mM Tris-HCl pH 8.0, 25 mM EDTA, 2M NaCl and 2% ß-mercaptoethanol. This suspension was then mixed with ice-cold chloroform was centrifuged 15 minutes at 16000 g. The upper phase was collected and mixed with 150µl of a 8M LiCl solution, incubated at -20 ºC for one hour and centrifuged 30 minutes at 16000 g. The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 30 µl RNAse free water and quantified using the Qubit. The Turbo DNA free kit (Ambion AM1907) was used to remove DNA. Total RNA samples were polyA enriched and reverse-transcribed into double stranded cDNA. A total of18 libraries were generated using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) using 1µg total RNA. Libraries were validated using the ddPCR Library quantification kit for Illumina TruSeq (Biorad 186-3040): Amplicons from all the libraries had approximately the same size and were at a 60-120nM concentration range.	7c66a4c5d4bc6df26ac20d9ecb1973fa	3196385910	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR458/009/ERR4588099/ERR4588099.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR458/009/ERR4588099/ERR4588099.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR458/009/ERR4588099/ERR4588099.fastq.gz

The RNA pellet was washed with 70% ethanol and resuspended in 30 µl RNAse free water and quantified using the Qubit. The Turbo DNA free kit (Ambion AM1907) was used to remove DNA. Total RNA samples were polyA enriched and reverse-transcribed into double stranded cDNA. A total of18 libraries were generated using the TruSeq RNA Sample Prep Kit (Illumina) using 1µg total RNA. Libraries were validated using the ddPCR Library quantification kit for Illumina TruSeq (Biorad 186-3040): Amplicons from all the libraries had approximately the same size and were at a 60-120nM concentration range.	e7a572091b683480bc97d778ec9573bb	2500369520	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR458/006/ERR4588116/ERR4588116.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR458/006/ERR4588116/ERR4588116.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR458/006/ERR4588116/ERR4588116.fastq.gz
