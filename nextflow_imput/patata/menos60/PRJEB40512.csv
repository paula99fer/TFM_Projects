Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 accession was used. Seeds were planted and incubated 5 days at 4ºC in peat moss and vermiculite (3:2 V/V). Plants were then grown in growth chambers (Sanyo MLR-350-H) under control conditions (23ºC±1ºC, &gt;70% relative humidity and a 16 h/8 h day/night photoperiod). A colony of Tetranychus urticae, London strain (Acari: Tetranychidae) provided by Dr. Miodrag Grbic (UWO, Canada), was reared on beans (Phaseolus vulgaris) and maintained in growth chambers (Sanyo MLR-350-H) at 25ºC±1ºC, &gt;70% relative humidity and a 16h/8h day/night photoperiod. Mites were synchronized and four-week-old plants were infested with 20 T. urticae female adults per plant. They were carefully transferred with a brush to the leaf surface. Total RNA was isolated from frozen rosettes and purified by using the RNeasy Qiagen Mini Plant Kit (74904 Qiagen), including the on-column DNA I (79254, Qiagen) digestion recommended by the manufacturer. RNA amount and quality were tested in a Nanodrop ND-1000.  Using poly-T oligo-attached magnetic beads, mRNAs were purified from the total RNA. Then, the mRNAs were fragmented and cDNA was synthesized using random hexamer-primers, DNA polymerase I and RNase H. The double-stranded cDNAs were purified with magnetic beads and ligated to adaptors for Illumina sequencing.
