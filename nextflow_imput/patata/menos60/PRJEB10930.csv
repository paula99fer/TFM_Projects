The seeds were sown in 85g +/- 1g of Saniflor compost (Van Isreal N.V., Geraardsbergen, Belgium) with an absolute water content of +/- 70%. The seeds were covered with plastic foil until 5 DAS, when the automated watering was started. When runs with mutants were performed, the pots were randomized to homogenously mix mutant and wild-type plants. All plants were watered daily from 5 days after stratification (DAS) until 11 DAS with a WW regime of 2.2 gwater/gsoil. At 12 DAS, half of the pots (random positions) were maintained at the WW regime, while the other half were not watered until the end of the experiment at 17 DAS. Arabidopsis Col-0 were grown under a long-day regime (light from 6AM until 10PM, intensity 110-120 μmol m-2 s-1) at 21°C. All reported experiments were performed on the WIWAM platform (http://www.wiwam.be). In our setup, four seedlings were grown per pot in order to grow 864 seedlings simultaneously on the platform.
