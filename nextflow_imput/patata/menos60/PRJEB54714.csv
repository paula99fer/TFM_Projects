The plants were grown in the Greenhouse under long day conditions.  Total ribosome footprints were prepared from a mix of flower buds and open flowers. About 2.5 g of flowers were ground in liquid nitrogen and resuspended in 15 ml of ribosome extraction buffer (0.2 M sucrose, 0.2 M KCl, 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8, 10 mM MgCl2, 10 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 2% polyoxyethylene 10 tridecyl ether, 1% Triton X-100, 100 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 mg/ml cycloheximide). The obtained solution was centrifuged twice for 10 min at 15 000 g at 4◦C to remove the cell debris and the supernatant was transferred to a new tube. To estimate the RNA concentration contained in the supernatant, total RNA was extracted from a 0.5 ml aliquot using the TRI Reagent® (Sigma- Aldrich) following the manufacturer’s instructions. The supernatant was then digested with 10 U/OD260nm/ml of RNAse I (Ambion), and incubated 1 h at 25◦C to degrade unprotected RNA. The solution was then layered on an equal volume of a sucrose cushion (1 M Sucrose, 0.1 M KCl, 40 mM Tris-acetate, pH 8, 15 mM MgCl2, 5 mM b-mercaptoethanol, 100 mg/ml chloramphenicol and 100 mg/ml cycloheximide) and centrifuged for 3 h at 55 000 g at 4◦C in a TFT 65-13 rotor (Kontron).
