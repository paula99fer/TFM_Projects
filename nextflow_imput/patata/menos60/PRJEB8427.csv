Other accessions were obtained from NASC (N22660). Plants were flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen immediately upon harvest. RNAlater-ICE (Ambion), which prevents RNA from degrading, was cooled at -70 degree centigrade, added to the samples and was allowed to penetrate the tissue at -20 degree centigrade for 5 days. The third leaf was collected by microdissection under a microscope. Samples were microdissected in a Petri dish on dry ice to keep the samples below room temperature. Six Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh accessions (An-1, Blh-1, Col-0, Cvi-0, Oy-0 and Sha) were grown in a growth chamber under controlled environmental conditions (21 degree centigrade, 55% relative humidity, 16 h day/ 8 h night, 110-120 micromol m-2 s-1 light intensity). Plants were germinated in soil-filled 96-well plates after four days of stratification at 4 degreee centigrade in the dark. Seedlings were transferred to pots at four days after stratification (DAS). The 54 average-sized seedlings were selected (Fig. 1A) using an in-house developed image algorithm in order to reduce seedling size effects at the beginning of the experiment. Before transfer, the relative water content of the pots was set at 1.2 g H2O/g dry soil for the mild drought treatment, the control condition was set at 2.2 g H2O/g dry soil (Fig. 1D). Once the seedlings were transferred to pots (Fig. 1B), they were placed on the automated phenotyping platfor	d2f4c0ac1f843c2f15141e9993046a68;97d04cd5bdc4ca461196dfea5a403e18	2322867142;2287320733	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR754/ERR754089/ERR754089_2.fastq.gz
