Two wells, one from each of two plates, were combined per sample, for a total of four plants (2 seedlings per well). Arabidopsis seeds were germinated on 1/2 strength MS 1% sucrose 0.8% phytoagar plates after 3-5 days stratification on plates. 4-day-old seedlings were moved in sterile conditions to liquid 1/2 MS 1% sucrose in 24-well plates, 2 seedlings and 1mL media per well. Seedlings were allowed to grow for 9 more days. When seedlings were 13 days old, MS media was decanted, and 600 uL fresh media added to each well. Plates were left overnight. When seedlings were 14 days old, 400 uL of 2.5x elf18 solution (2.5 uM in 1/2 MS, 1% sucrose) or mock (1/2 MS, 1% sucrose) was added to each well, for a final concentration of 1 uM in 1 mL or mock in 1 mL. Seedlings remained in elicitor solution for 10,30, or 90 minutes before harvesting. Total RNA was extracted via a standard TRIzol extraction. Briefly, frozen tissue was ground, TRIzol solution added to powder, and cell debris pelleted by centrifugation. The aqueous phase of the TRIzol was then removed and RNA precipitated via an isopropanol precipitation followed by ethanol wash.
