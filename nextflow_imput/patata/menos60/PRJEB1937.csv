Plants were grown at 22  degreesC  with a 10/14 h light/dark period and a light intensity of 120 umol m-2s-1. When seedlings had reached the 4-leaf stage the priming treatment was applied directly to the roots. Roots and shoots were harvested immediately after the priming treatment . The tissue was stored at -80  degreesC. The priming treatment consisted in application of 5 ml of growth medium supplemented with 50 mM NaCl directly to the roots of the plate-grown seedlings. Control plants were treated in the same way using nutrient medium without NaCl added. Plants were incubated with the priming (or control) solution for 24 hours. After grinding of the frozen tissues, RNA was extracted with the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacture instructions, and reverse transcribed to cDNA using QuantiTect(r) Reverse Transcription kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq libraries were prepared using mRNA 8-Sample Prep Kit (Illumina). Briefly, polyA RNA was isolated from 1 ug of total RNA, fragmented, and subjected to first- and second-strand cDNA synthesis with random primers.	09e78fd581fabbd1329881da92437697	1938484466	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR274/ERR274310/ERR274310.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR274/ERR274310/ERR274310.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR274/ERR274310/ERR274310.fastq.gz
