Protocols: To generate one biological replicate sample, 18 full-grown leaves from 6 different plants (3 leaves per plant) were harvested 24 h after the respective treatment and pooled. In total, three biologically independent, replicate experiments were performed. As a result, three biologically independent samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained. RNA-seq analysis of the resulting 21 samples was performed as described in the accompanying protocols. Individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultivated in pots filled with a mixture of soil (Substrat BP3; Klasmann-Deilmann), vermiculite, and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled plant growth room. A 10-h-day (9 AM to 7 PM)/14-h-night cycle with a photon flux density of approximately 100 μmol m-2 s-1 during the day and a relative humidity of 60% was applied. Day and night temperatures were set to 21 and 18 °C, respectively. Experiments were performed with five-week old plants. To investigate the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis wild-type plants (Col-0) and selected mutants (npr1-3 and sid2-1) to elevated NHP (or Pip), individual, 5-week-old soil-grown plants, exhibiting a uniform appearance, were supplied via the root with 10 μmol NHP, 10 μmol Pip (only in the case of Col-0 plants), or treated with an equivalent volume of water, which served as solvent and thus control treatment.

In total, three biologically independent, replicate experiments were performed. As a result, three biologically independent samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained. RNA-seq analysis of the resulting 21 samples was performed as described in the accompanying protocols. Individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants were cultivated in pots filled with a mixture of soil (Substrat BP3; Klasmann-Deilmann), vermiculite, and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled plant growth room. A 10-h-day (9 AM to 7 PM)/14-h-night cycle with a photon flux density of approximately 100 μmol m-2 s-1 during the day and a relative humidity of 60% was applied. Day and night temperatures were set to 21 and 18 °C, respectively. Experiments were performed with five-week old plants. To investigate the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis wild-type plants (Col-0) and selected mutants (npr1-3 and sid2-1) to elevated NHP (or Pip), individual, 5-week-old soil-grown plants, exhibiting a uniform appearance, were supplied via the root with 10 μmol NHP, 10 μmol Pip (only in the case of Col-0 plants), or treated with an equivalent volume of water, which served as solvent and thus control treatment.
