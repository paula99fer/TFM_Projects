For each sample, the shoot apical region was manually dissected from approximately 1,300 INTACT reporter plants and frozen immediately in Eppendorf tubes suspended in liquid nitrogen.  Plants of the meristem-specific INTACT reporter line were cultivated in growth chambers, in short-day (SD) conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) for 21 days and then shifted to long-day (LD) conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) to induce flowering.  The growth-chamber condition was at 23°C with 65% relative humidity, and with the light at a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m−2 s−1.

Low Input Library Prep Kit (Clontech) was used for preparation of sequencing libraries	1971c6c4476b140d71cc0bfffb8f553c;3b6edb1fc5522d1dc95304daecd3afb2	285274739;356628372	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR169/001/ERR1698201/ERR1698201_2.fastq.gz
