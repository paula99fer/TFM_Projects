In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained.  Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil (Substrat BP3; Klasmann-Deilmann), vermiculite, and sand (8:1:1) in an enviromentally controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h-day (9 AM to 7 PM)/14-h-night cycle. Relative humidity in the growth chambers was adjusted to 60% and day and night temperatures were set to 21°C and 18°C, respectively Experiments were performed with 5- to 6-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance.Treatments with pipecolic acid (Pip) were essentially performed as detailed in Návarová et al. (2012).10 ml of a 1 mM aqueous solution of Pip (equates to 10 µmol) were pipetted onto the soil of individually cultivated 5-week-old plants. 10 ml of water were applied in the control treatments. Three biologically independent, replicate experiments were performed. In each experiment, 24 hours after the watering with Pip or water, at least 4 full-grown leaves from 6 different plants were pooled for one biological replicate. RNA was extracted from leaf sample replicates with the Plant RNeasy extraction kit (Qiagen, Germany), and treated on-column (Qiagen, Germany) and in solution with RNA-f...	f462e5766dbe80e50bbaa936e67c2031	400782513	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR220/004/ERR2204434/ERR2204434.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR220/004/ERR2204434/ERR2204434.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR220/004/ERR2204434/ERR2204434.fastq.gz
