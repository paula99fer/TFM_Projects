Plants were grown in soil at 21 ̊C under a 16-h day (80-100 µmol m-2 s-1) and 8-h night regime.  Stroby® WG (BASF), a commercially available strobilurin consisting of 50% (w/w) KM as active ingredient and 50% surfactants, was dissolved in water and used as source of KM at a concentration of 10-9 M. Library preparation was done using the TruSeq RNA Sample Preparation Kit v2 (Illumina). Briefly, polyA-containing mRNA molecules were reverse transcribed, double-stranded cDNA was generated and adapters were ligated. After quality control using a 2100 Bioanalyzer (Agilent), clusters were generated through amplification using the TruSeq PE Cluster Kit v3-cBot-HS kit (Illumina).
