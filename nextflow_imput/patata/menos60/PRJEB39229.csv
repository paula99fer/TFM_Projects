The leaf material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Plants were grown for 4 weeks under short day (10 h light/14 h dark and 20 °C/16 °C, respectively). The relative humidity during the day and night was 50 %. Four-week-old plants were transferred at 11 am (5 h after turning on the light) for 4 h either to dark (0 µE, 22 °C) or low light (100-130 µE, 22 °C). Around 100 mg of Arabidopsis leaf tissue was ground to a fine powder, followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality were determined by NanoDrop 1000. Sequencing libraries were generated from poly(A)-enriched RNA using the NEBNext Ultra II Directional RNA Library Prep kit (New England Biolabs) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	27eed2fd927606d6f1938cd32dc2ccc9	653062061	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR431/007/ERR4318757/ERR4318757.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR431/007/ERR4318757/ERR4318757.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR431/007/ERR4318757/ERR4318757.fastq.gz

The leaf material was frozen in liquid nitrogen and stored at -80 °C. Plants were grown for 4 weeks under short day (10 h light/14 h dark and 20 °C/16 °C, respectively). The relative humidity during the day and night was 50 %. Four-week-old plants were transferred at 11 am (5 h after turning on the light) for 4 h either to dark (0 µE, 22 °C) or low light (100-130 µE, 22 °C). Around 100 mg of Arabidopsis leaf tissue was ground to a fine powder, followed by RNA extraction using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. RNA concentration and quality were determined by NanoDrop 1000.
