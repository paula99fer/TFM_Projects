Seedlings were grown vertically under a 16h day (125 microE m-2 s-1 photosynthetically active radiation)/8h night cycle for seven days as described previously (Branco-Price et al. 2008). Seven-day old seedlings were harvested at the end of the light period.	761a9fbaf64d6826649d9a3e9d86e225	237486682	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR515/SRR515071/SRR515071.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR515/SRR515071/SRR515071.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR515/SRR515071/SRR515071.fastq.gz
