Here, we performed RNA-seq analysis to evaluate possible mechanisms of cytokinin-delayed senescence. Cotyledons were excised from 12 day-old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings and were floated on MES buffer pH 5.7. Buffer was supplemented with either 1uM cytokinin or an equivalent volume (0.1%) DMSO as a vehicle control. Cytokinins tested included iP, iP-7-glucoside, and iP-9-glucoside. The treatment took place over six days in the dark to allow senescence to take place. At the end of the six days, RNA was extracted.	f5318ac2f830a11e8d7096785d058093;b583e121108c22b31e2e8ecf2b072d4b	4710505418;4900156686	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR114/060/SRR11450260/SRR11450260_2.fastq.gz
