Plants of the shoot-phloem-companion-cell-tagged  INTACT reporter line (Transgenic SUC2::redNTF and UBQ10::BirA in Col-0 background) were cultivated in growth chambers, in short-day (SD) conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) for 21 days and then shifted to long-day (LD) conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) to induce flowering.  The growth-chamber condition was at 23°C with 65% relative humidity, and with the light at a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m−2 s−1.

The 0LD, 1LD, 2LD and 3LD samples were collected on the 21st day in SDs and 1, 2, and 3 days after the shift to LD. For each sample, the whole shoot material was collected from approximately 120 seedlings and frozen immediately in Eppendorf tubes suspended in liquid nitrogen.  Plants of the shoot-phloem-companion-cell-tagged  INTACT reporter line (Transgenic SUC2::redNTF and UBQ10::BirA in Col-0 background) were cultivated in growth chambers, in short-day (SD) conditions (8 h light/16 h dark) for 21 days and then shifted to long-day (LD) conditions (16 h light/8 h dark) to induce flowering.  The growth-chamber condition was at 23°C with 65% relative humidity, and with the light at a fluence rate of 125 to 175 μmol m−2 s−1. Total nuclear RNA was extracted from approximately 10,000 nuclei of each sample using the RNeasy Micro Kit (Qiagen). Genomic DNA was removed by DNase I treatment (Thermo Scientific).
