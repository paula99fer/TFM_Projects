Illumina HiSeq 2500 paired end sequencing; Salicylic acid-induced gene expression in wild-type Col-0 and mutant upl3-4 Arabidopsis thaliana plants.	Protocols: Tissue was collected by excising leaves at the petiole. Leaves were then packaged in aluminium foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80 degrees celcius.  Seeds were germinated on soil in 100% relative humidity. After 12 days seedlings were transplanted to larger pots (6 plants per pot) and grown for an additional 3 weeks. Plants were watered as required. Growth conditions: 16/8 hours light/dark cycle (120 mol m-2 s-1), 21/18 degrees Celsius day/night cycle, 65% relative humidity.  Plants were sprayed with a spray bottle that produced fine mist. Leaves were sprayed with water or 0.5 mM SA until thoroughly covered in fine droplets. After 24 hours leaf tissue was harvested for analysis.  1) Grind tissue very fine in liquid nitrogen. 2) Add 0.5 ml RNA extraction buffer (warmed to ~80ºC) and 0.5 ml phenol:chloroform:isoamylalcohol mixture (25:24:1). Vortex vigorously. 3) Centrifuge max. speed for 5 min. at 4ºC, but do not put samples on ice. 4) Transfer the aqueous phase (upper phase) to a new tube. 5) Add 0.5 ml cold chloroform:isoamylalcohol (24:1) and vortex vigorously. 6) Centrifuge max. speed for 5 min. at 4ºC, but do not put samples on ice. 7) Repeat steps 4, 5, and 6. 8)Transfer the aqueous phase to a new tube on ice and add 1/3 volume of 8 M LiCl.

Protocols: Tissue was collected by excising leaves at the petiole. Leaves were then packaged in aluminium foil and frozen in liquid nitrogen before storing at -80 degrees celcius.  Seeds were germinated on soil in 100% relative humidity. After 12 days seedlings were transplanted to larger pots (6 plants per pot) and grown for an additional 3 weeks.
