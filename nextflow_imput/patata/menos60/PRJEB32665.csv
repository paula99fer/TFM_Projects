For recalcitrant samples (seed, silique, pollen), we adopted a LiCl-based protocol with minor modifications (Onate-Sanchez and Vicente-Carbajosa, 2008). After LiCl precipitation the RNA pellet was dissolved in rDNAse buffer (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany) and treated with rDNAse (Macherey-Nagel, Düren, Germany). The final pellet was re-suspended in DEPC-treated water. cDNA libraries were prepared using the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Ilumina, San Diego, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.	45c3bc530a936a577f4bd5cdc4229ac3;9b65ff60c2bc181580704c219de06ab6	1901383380;1906694098	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR333/000/ERR3333410/ERR3333410_2.fastq.gz
