Roots were cutinto 3-mm explants at 0, 1, 3, 6 and 12 h after wounding. Plants were treated 24 h to the wounding treatment with either DMSO as a mock or 25 uM γ-butyrolactone (MB-3) dissolved in DMSO. Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Col-0) plants were grown on Murashige-Skoog (MS) media containing 1% sucrose and 0.6% (w/v) gelzan under continuous light conditions at 22°C.
