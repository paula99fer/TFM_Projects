In vitro cultures were maintained at 24C under a 16 h/ 8 h (light/dark) cycle in a culture room. Samples were collected after 10 d of in vitro culture. Approximately 700 embryogenic cultures induced at each time-point were pooled together to extract total RNA. Total RNA was extracted using the RNeasy® Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen, UK) according to the manufacturers protocol. The cDNA libraries were constructed in accordance with the Illumina TruSeq RNA sample preparation guide v2 for Illumina paired-end multiplexed sequencing.	9a5d47bdf529e5dde39f30211e84008f;73be07f11f7a0b56d899232ba1fef3da	4749147147;4790561175	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR466/ERR466188/ERR466188_2.fastq.gz
