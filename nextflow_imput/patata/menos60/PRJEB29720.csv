Seedlings were harvested at ZT8 (2 pm) and ZT16 (10 pm). RNA was isolated using the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen) and DNase I treated (Promega). The library of cDNA template molecules of known strand origin was obtained using the reagents provided in the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation Kits.	e567dda8bae18e80bf1c3a2b02ce833c	1324309366	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR290/009/ERR2900299/ERR2900299.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR290/009/ERR2900299/ERR2900299.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR290/009/ERR2900299/ERR2900299.fastq.gz
