Total RNA was extracted in TRIzol reagent, precipitated with isopropanol and washed two times in ethanol 70%. RNA was then DNase treated using 1 unit of RQ1 DNAse (Promega) per μg of RNA, following manufacturer&apos;s instructions. Following DNase treatment, RNAs were further purified in phenol-chloroform. RNA integrity was assessed by running 1ug of RNA through a agarose gel supplemented with formaldehyde after denaturation in 1X MOPS 4% formaldehyde for 15 minutes at 65°C.
