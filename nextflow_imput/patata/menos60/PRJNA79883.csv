Plants were grown in a growth room in soil or hydroponically and leaf tissue harvested after 17-20 days.  cDNA was prepared and the desired tags made as described in Wu et al. (submitted).  These paired-end tags are bar-coded and mixed with other samples in the various experiments.  Wild-type leaf tags have the following codes:  5&apos; reads begin with either CATG or ACGT, and 3&apos; reads begin with the sequence NNNCCTTTT.  These codes can be used to extract leaf tags for analysis.	0c83bb3adb9bf2d4f3eccfa45e45397a;847dba4a823383dcd712e5085e7f807d	586460829;419447729	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/SRR089/SRR089763/SRR089763_2.fastq.gz
