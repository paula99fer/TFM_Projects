Samples were collected at 4 h intervals, starting at 24 h after transfer to LL until 68 h post-transfer to LL. Col-0 seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog medium (GIBCO BRL) and cold stratified (4ºC, darkness) for 3 days. The MS plates were transferred to 22 °C under LD12:12 (12 h light/12 h dark cycles; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light) conditions for 11 days and then transferred to continuous light (LL; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher). Total RNA integrity was further checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Libraries were prepared following the TruSeq RNA v2 Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA was polyA-purified and fragmented, and first-strand cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) and random hexamers. This was followed by RNA degradation and second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair process and addition of a single A nucleotide to the 3′ ends allowed ligation of multiple indexing adapters. Then, an enrichment step of 12 cycles of PCR was performed. Library validation included size and purity assessment with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies).	9833738e06973c8164c83fbe4d377a76;53bb413ec887f0cfd0d27f19fcafc5c0	746562601;748995071	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310285/ERR3310285_2.fastq.gz

Col-0 seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog medium (GIBCO BRL) and cold stratified (4ºC, darkness) for 3 days. The MS plates were transferred to 22 °C under LD12:12 (12 h light/12 h dark cycles; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light) conditions for 11 days and then transferred to continuous light (LL; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light).

Total RNA integrity was further checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Libraries were prepared following the TruSeq RNA v2 Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA was polyA-purified and fragmented, and first-strand cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) and random hexamers. This was followed by RNA degradation and second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair process and addition of a single A nucleotide to the 3′ ends allowed ligation of multiple indexing adapters.

This was followed by RNA degradation and second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair process and addition of a single A nucleotide to the 3′ ends allowed ligation of multiple indexing adapters. Then, an enrichment step of 12 cycles of PCR was performed. Library validation included size and purity assessment with the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer and the Agilent DNA 1000 kit (Agilent Technologies).	516166c3cdba477a4ff9ab42642a3e5e;186a090760261af70777d3c595500a7f	949633630;954822577	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_2.fastq.gz	ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_1.fastq.gz;ftp.sra.ebi.ac.uk/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_2.fastq.gz	fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_1.fastq.gz;fasp.sra.ebi.ac.uk:/vol1/fastq/ERR331/005/ERR3310305/ERR3310305_2.fastq.gz

Samples were collected at 4 h intervals, starting at 24 h after transfer to LL until 68 h post-transfer to LL. Col-0 seeds were sown on Murashige and Skoog medium (GIBCO BRL) and cold stratified (4ºC, darkness) for 3 days. The MS plates were transferred to 22 °C under LD12:12 (12 h light/12 h dark cycles; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light) conditions for 11 days and then transferred to continuous light (LL; 50 μmol·m−2·s−1 of white light). Total RNA was extracted using the Trizol method according to the manufacturer’s protocol (ThermoFisher) and quantified using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer (ThermoFisher). Total RNA integrity was further checked by agarose gel electrophoresis. Libraries were prepared following the TruSeq RNA v2 Sample Preparation Guide (Illumina). Briefly, 3 μg of total RNA was polyA-purified and fragmented, and first-strand cDNA synthesized by reverse transcriptase (SuperScript II; Invitrogen) and random hexamers. This was followed by RNA degradation and second-strand cDNA synthesis. End repair process and addition of a single A nucleotide to the 3′ ends allowed ligation of multiple indexing adapters.
