To restrict the analysis to the peridermis (avoiding the endodermis where GPAT5 is also being expressed in young parts of the root,), only a section of the root comprised between the root-hypocotyl junction and the first emerged lateral root was manually dissected. Seedlings were sown on solid half MS medium (Duchefa Biochemie B.V.) supplemented with 1% of Sucrose (VWR), 0.1g/L Myo-inositol (Sigma-Aldrich), 0.5 g/L MES (Duchefa Biochemie B.V.) and 0.8% Plant Agar (Lab M, MC029).
