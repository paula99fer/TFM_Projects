PRJNA903892	Revisiting AGAMOUS-LIKE15, a Key Somatic Embryogenesis 2 Regulator, using Next Generation Sequencing Analysis in Arabidopsis	AGAMOUS like 15 AGL15 is a member of the MADS domain transcription factor TF family. MADS proteins are named for a conserved domain that was originally from an acronym derived from genes expressed in a variety of eukaryotes. In plants, this family has expanded greatly, with more than one hundred members generally found in dicots, and the proteins encoded by these genes have often been associated with developmental identity. AGL15 is expressed primarily in embryos and has been found to promote an important process called plant regeneration via somatic embryogenesis SE. To understand how this TF performs this function, we have previously used microarray technologies to assess direct and indirect responsive targets of this TF. We have now revisited this question using next-generation sequencing NGS to both characterize in vivo binding sites for AGL15, as well as respond to the accumulation of AGL15. We have compared this data to the prior microarray results to evaluate the different platforms. The new NGS brought to light an interaction with brassinosteroid BR hormone signaling that was missed in prior gene ontology analysis from the microarray studies. Less...	
PRJNA896774	Arabidopsis thaliana isolate:Col0 (thale cress)Altering the balance between AOX1A and NDB2 expression affects a common set of transcripts in Arabidopsis	Stress-responsive components of the mitochondrial alternative electron transport pathway have the capacity to improve tolerance of plants to abiotic stress, particularly the alternative oxidase AOX1A but also external NAD(P)H dehydrogenases such as NDB2, in Arabidopsis. NDB2 and AOX1A can cooperate to entirely circumvent the classical electron transport chain in Arabidopsis mitochondria. Overexpression of AOX1A or NDB2 alone can have slightly negative impacts on plant growth under optimal conditions, while simultaneous overexpression of NDB2 and AOX1A can reverse these phenotypic effects. We have taken a global transcriptomic approach to better understand the molecular shifts that occur due to overexpression of AOX1A alone and with concomitant overexpression of NDB2. Of the transcripts that were significantly up- or down- regulated in the AOX1A overexpression line compared to wild type, the majority reverted to wild type levels in the dual overexpression line. Several mechanisms for the AOX1A overexpression phenotype are proposed. Many unique genes were deregulated in the NDB2 knockout line. Furthermore, several changes in transcript abundance seen in the NDB2 knockout line were consistent with changes in the AOX1A overexpression line. The results suggest that an imbalance in AOX1A:NDB2 protein levels caused by under- or overexpression of either component, triggers a common set of transcriptional responses that may be important in mitochondrial redox regulation. The most significant changes were transcripts associated with photosynthesis, secondary metabolism and oxidative stress responses Less...

Although it has been known that the change of DNA methylation mainly occurs at CHH context mediated by small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway during seed ripening and germination, casality of the methylation difference exhibited in natural ArabidopsisArabidopsis ecotypes has not been thoughly studied.Using comparative pairwise multi-omic dynamics in Col-0 and Cape Verde Island (Cvi)-0, we found transcriptome were relatively dynamic in stage-widse whereas DNA methylome were more ecotype-dependent. These ecotype-specific differentially methylated regions (eDMR) are significantly overlap with ecotype-specific 24-nt small RNA clusters (e24sRCs).

PRJNA883821	The SMC5/6 complex recruits the PAF1 complex to facilitate DNA double-strand break repair	DNA double-strand break (DSB) is the most toxic form of DNA damage, which threatens genome stability and is a major cause for cancers. Homologous recombination (HR) is an error-free DSB repair pathway, in which the evolutionarily conserved SMC5/6 complex (SMC5/6C) plays essential roles. The PAF1 complex (PAF1C) is also evolutionarily conserved and is well-known to regulate transcription. Here we have shown that SMC5/6 recruits PAF1C to facilitate DSB repair. In a genetic screen for DNA Damage Response Mutants (DDRMs), we found that the Arabidopsis ddrm4 mutant is hypersensitive to DSB-inducing agents. DDRM4 encodes PAF1, a core subunit of PAF1C. Interestingly, loss of the other subunits of PAF1C also result in hypersensitivity to DSB-inducing agents. Mechanistically, SMC5/6 directly interacts with PAF1 and recruits PAF1 to DSB sites. Notably, overexpression of PAF1 partially suppresses the defects of the smc6 mutant. Moreover, we found that PAF1C facilitates DSB repair by recruiting the E2 ubiquitin-conjugating enzymes UBC1 and UBC2 and the E3 ubiquitin ligases HUB1 and HUB2, which mediate the monoubiquitination of H2B at DSB sites. Our results suggest that SMC5/6-PAF1C-UBC1/2-HUB1/2 is a new axis for DSB repair, thereby revealing a new mechanism of SMC5/6 and uncovering a new function of PAF1C. Less...

PRJNA904293	Elucidating the unknown transcriptional responses and PHR1 mediated biotic and abiotic stress tolerance during phosphorus-limitation	Phosphorus (P) limitation in the majority of world soils is a major constraint for plant growth and crop productivity. RNA sequencing was used to discover novel P-responsive gene transcripts (PRGT) in leaves and roots of Arabidopsis. Hisat StringTie and Cufflinks TopHat transcript assembler were used to analyze reads and identify 1,074 PRGTs with a >5-fold altered abundance during P-limitation. Interestingly, 60% of these transcripts were not previously reported. Among the novel PRGT, 106 were from unannotated genes, and some were among the most P-responsive, including At2g36727 which encodes a novel microRNA. Annotated novel PRGTs encode for transcription factors, microRNAs, small signaling peptides, long non-coding RNAs, defense-related proteins, and transporters, along with proteins involved in many biological processes. We identified several genes that undergo alternative splicing during P-limitation, including a novel miR399 resistant splice variant of PHOSPHATE2 (PHO2.2). Several novel P-responsive genes were regulated by PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1), PHR1-LIKE 1 (PHL1) and PHO2. We discovered that P-limited plants show increased resistance to pathogens and drought stress mediated by PHR1-PHL1. Identification of novel P-responsive transcripts and the discovery of the influence of P-limitation on biotic and abiotic stress adds a significant component to our understanding of plant P-signaling.

PRJNA852208	Genome editing in plants using the compact editor CasΦ	"CRISPR-Cas systems have been developed as important tools for plant genome engineering. Here, we demonstrate that the hypercompact CasΦ nuclease is able to generate stably inherited gene edits in Arabidopsis, and that CasΦ guide RNAs can be expressed with either the Pol-III U6 promoter or a Pol-II promoter together with ribozyme mediated RNA processing. Using the Arabidopsis fwa epiallele we show that CasΦ displays higher editing efficiency when the target locus is not DNA methylated, suggesting that CasΦ is sensitive to chromatin environment. Importantly, two CasΦ protein variants, vCasΦ and nCasΦ, both showed much higher editing efficiency relative to the wildtype CasΦ enzyme, and yielded more offspring plants with inherited edits. Extensive genomic analysis of gene edited plants showed no off-target editing, suggesting that CasΦ is highly specific. The hypercompact size, flexible PAM and wide range of working temperatures make CasΦ an excellent addition to existing plant genome editing systems.

PRJNA879695	Activation of a singlet oxygen signaling pathway by competition cues in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"The goal of this work was to investigate oxidative stress responses of Arabidopsis to low red to far-red ratios of light as a signal of competition using a biological weedy and an artificial source of far-red light. More specifically, elucidation of the signaling role of singlet oxygen in Arabidopsis under low red-to far-red light environments was the major objective of this work.
Oxidative stress responses of Arabidopsis to low red (R) to far-red (FR) signals (R:FR ≈ 0.3), generated by a biological weedy and an artificial source of FR light, were compared with a weed-free control (R:FR ≈1.4). In the low R:FR treatments, induction of the shade avoidance responses coincided with increased singlet oxygen (1O2) production and decreased level of superoxide and superoxide dismutase activity. Although the increase of 1O2 was not due to protochlorophyllide accumulation and did not result in cell death, treatments with the 1O2 generator 5-aminolevulinic acid increased sensitivity to cell death. Transcriptome responses minimally resembled those reported in four Arabidopsis 1O2 generating systems such that only few genes (6 out of 1931) were consistently up-regulated supporting the specificity of 1O2 signaling. Moreover, suppressors of jasmonate accumulation, including the 1O2-responsive amidohydrolase ILL6, the sulfotransferase ST2a, which are involved in prioritization of elongation growth versus defense were consistently up-regulated. Our data support a model in which photoreceptors connect low R:FR light cues to the JA signaling pathway. Repression of bioactive JAs via the amidohydrolase ILL6, and sulfotransferase ST2a may promote the shade avoidance (versus defense) and 1O2 acclimation (versus cell death) responses to competition cues.
Overall design: Total RNA was extracted from 4-week-old rosette leaves of wild type Arabidopsis thaliana (ecotype Columbia). In total, 9 samples consisting of 3 treatments with 3 replicates, each consisting of a pool of leaves from 3 individual plants, were analyzed. The 3 treatments consisted of a weed-free control (high red to far-red light ratio), a biological low red to far-red light ratio using a surrogate weed, and an artificial low red to far-red light ratio using far-red LEDs. The red to far-red ratios (R:FR) at the plant level was approximately 1.4, 0.3 and 0.3 in the control, biological low R:FR, and artificial low R:FR treatments, respectively. In all treatments, plastic tubes were placed in the center of the experimental pots and plastic cups containing the Arabidopsis plants were inserted in the central tubes. This experimental set up prevented direct root contact between the surrogate weed and Arabidopsis plants. In the control treatment, Arabidopsis plants were grown at an R:FR ≈ 1.4 for 4 weeks, whereas plants in the biological and artificial low R:FR treatments were grown at an R:FR ≈ 1.4 for 3 weeks and transferred to the respective low R:FR light treatments (R:FR ≈ 0.3) for 1 week.

To acquire co-transcriptional RNA is easy to understand the RNA transcription status. We use a simple and effective way to separate the intact cell nucleus and wash the nucleoplasm, then acquire the chromatin component.

We demonstrate the method descripted in this paper can be suitable for analyze co-transcriptional splicing ratio effectively. Interestingly, we find the first intron globally has lower co-transcriptional splicing efficiency.

PRJNA883212	Condensation of SEUSS promotes hyperosmotic stress tolerance in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Osmotic stress imposed by drought and high salinity inhibits plant growth and crop yield. However, our current knowledge on the mechanism by which plants sense osmotic stress is still limited. Here, we identify the transcriptional regulator, SEUSS (SEU) as a key player during hyperosmotic stress in Arabidopsis. SEU rapidly coalesces into liquid-like nuclear condensates when extracellular osmolarity increases. The intrinsically disordered region 1 (IDR1) of SEU directly senses cell volume decrease resulted from osmotic stress. IDR1 undergoes conformational changes to adopt more compact states upon the increase of macromolecular crowding both in vitro and in cells, and two predicted α-helical peptides are required. SEU condensation is indispensable for osmotic stress tolerance and loss of SEU dramatically compromises the expression of stress-tolerance genes. Our work uncovers a critical role of biomolecular condensates in cellular stress perception and response, and expands our understanding of the osmotic stress pathway.

PRJNA835893	Single-nucleus RNA-seq reveals that MBD5, MBD6, and SILENZIO maintain silencing in the vegetative cell of developing pollen (thale cress)	"Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) drove the evolution of numerous redundant mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. Arabidopsis MBD5, MBD6, and SILENZIO act as TE repressors downstream of DNA methylation. Here we show via single-nucleus RNA-seq of developing male gametophytes that these repressors are critical for TE silencing in the pollen vegetative cell, which undergoes epigenetic reprogramming causing chromatin decompaction to support fertilization by sperm cells. Instead, other silencing mutants (met1, ddm1, mom1, morc) show loss of silencing in all pollen nucleus types and somatic cells. We found that TEs repressed by MBD5/6 gain accessibility in wild-type vegetative nuclei despite remaining silent, suggesting that loss of DNA compaction makes them sensitive to loss of MBD5/6. Consistently, crossing mbd5/6 to histone 1 mutants, which have decondensed chromatin in leaves, reveals derepression of MBD5/6-dependent TEs in leaves. MBD5/6 and SILENZIO thus act as a silencing system especially important when chromatin compaction is compromised.

Yttrium oxide nanoparticles are important members of rare earth oxides nanoparticles. The molecular mechanism of its influence on plant growth and development and plant response to them is unclear. In this study, we found that yttrium oxide nanoparticles above 2 mM significantly inhibited the growth of Arabidopsis seedlings. Using the Arabidopsis marker lines reflecting auxin signal, it was found that the treatment of yttrium oxide nanoparticles led to the disorder of auxin signal in root cells: the auxin signal in quiescent center cells and columella stem cells decreased; while the auxin signal in the stele cells was enhanced. In addition, trypan blue staining showed that yttrium oxide nanoparticles caused the death of root cells. Transcriptome sequencing analysis showed that yttrium oxide nanoparticles specifically inhibited the expression of lignin synthesis related genes, activated mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling pathway, and enhanced ethylene and ABA signaling pathways in plants. This study revealed the phytotoxicity of yttrium oxide nanoparticles at the molecular level, and provided a new perspective at the molecular level for plants to respond to rare earth oxide stress.

PRJNA859508	Peptide ligand-mediated trade-off between plant growth and stress response (thale cress)	"The decision of whether to grow or to divert energy to stress response is a key physiological trade-off for plants seeking to survive under fluctuating environments. However, the cell-to-cell communication underlying this decision is largely unknown. Here we show that three orphan leucine-rich repeat receptor kinases (LRR-RKs) act as direct ligand-perceiving receptors for PSY-family peptides and play a key role in local switching between two opposing pathways. In contrast to the known LRR-RKs which activate signaling upon ligand binding, PSY receptor (PSYR) signaling, which intrinsically induces a stress response, usually is repressed by ligands to permit growth. Conversely, PSYRs activate the expression of various genes encoding stress response transcription factors upon depletion of the ligands. Loss of PSYRs resulted in defects in the plant’s tolerance to both biotic and abiotic stresses. This ligand-deprivation-dependent activation system enables plants to exert exquisitely tuned regulation of stress responses in the tissues proximal to metabolically dysfunctional damaged sites where ligand production is impaired.

H1.2 was identified as a DME-interacting protein in a yeast two-hybrid screen, and maternal genome H1 loss affects DNA methylation and expression of selected imprinted genes in the endosperm. Yet, the extent to which how H1 influences DME demethylation and gene imprinting in theArabidopsisendosperm has not been investigated. Here, we showed that unlike in the vegetative cell, both canonical histone H1 variants are present in the central cell. Our endosperm methylome analysis revealed that without the maternal linker histones, DME-mediated demethylation is facilitated, particularly in the heterochromatin regions, indicating that H1-containing nucleosomes are barriers for DME demethylation. Loss of H1 in the maternal genome has a very limited effect on gene transcription or gene imprinting regulation in the endosperm; however, it variably influences euchromatin TE methylation and causes a slight hypermethylation and a reduced expression in selected imprinted genes. We conclude that loss of maternal H1 indirectly influences DME-mediated demethylation and endosperm DNA methylation landscape but does not appear to affect endosperm gene transcription and overall imprinting regulation.
Overall design: RNA sequencing using wt (Col x Ler) and h1-hybrid (h1 triple x Ler) F1 embryo and endosperm (3 bio replicates for each genotype and tissue) were performed to examine the effect of maternal H1 loss on embryo and endosperm transcriptomes.

Leaf infection assays show reduced S. sclerotiorum lesion size, fungal load, and ABHYDROLASE-3 transcript abundance in AT1703 lines compared to wild-type Col-0. To better understand how HIGS influences host-pathogen interactions, we performed global RNA sequencing on AT1703 and wild-type Col-0 lines directly at the site of S. sclerotiorum infection.

PRJNA909785	Dissecting the Arabidopsis/downy mildew interaction by haustoriated cell-specific RNA profiling (thale cress)	"The downy mildew oomycete Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis, an obligate filamentous pathogen, infect Arabidopsis by forming feeding structures called haustoria inside the host cell. Previous transcriptome analysis revealed host genes specifically induced during infection. However, whole infected tissue-derived RNA profiling may fail to capture the key transcriptional events that may occur exclusively in haustoriated host cells where the pathogen injects virulence effectors to modulate host immunity for successful accommodation. To understand the interaction between Arabidopsis and H. arabidopsidis at the cellular level, we established a new translating ribosome affinity purification (TRAP) system applicable to pathogen-responsive promoters, enabling haustoriated cell-specific RNA profiling. Among the host genes specifically expressed in H. arabidopsidis-haustoriated cells, we found genes that promote either susceptibility or resistance to the pathogen, providing new insights into the Arabidopsis/downy mildew interaction. We also expect that our new TRAP system could be applicable to several stimulus-specific contexts as well as other plant–pathogen interactions.

PRJNA915339	Coordinated histone variant H2A.Z eviction and H3.3 deposition control plant thermomorphogenesis [RNA-seq III] (thale cress)	"Plants can sense temperature changes and adjust their development and morphology accordingly in a process called thermomorphogenesis. This phenotypic plasticity implies complex mechanisms regulating gene expression reprogramming in response to environmental alteration. Histone variants contribute to the chromatin dynamics and transcriptional control, yet how their deposition/eviction modulates transcriptional changes induced by environmental cues remains elusive. In Arabidopsis thaliana, temperature elevation-induced transcriptional activation at thermo-responsive genes entails the chromatin eviction of a histone variant H2A.Z by INO80, which is recruited to these loci via interacting with a key thermomorphogenesis regulator PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4). Here, we show that both INO80 and the deposition chaperones of another histone variant H3.3 associate with EARLY FLOWERING7 (ELF7), a critical component of the transcription elongation factor polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1c). H3.3 promotes thermomorphogenesis and the high temperature-enhanced RNA Pol II transcription at PIF4 targets, and it is broadly required for the H2A.Z removal-induced gene activation. Reciprocally, INO80 and ELF7 regulate H3.3 deposition, and are necessary for the high temperature-induced H3.3 enrichment at PIF4 targets. Our findings demonstrate close coordination between H2A.Z eviction and H3.3 deposition in gene activation induced by high temperature, and pinpoint the importance of histone variants dynamics in transcriptional regulation.

The Arabidopsis GBP orthologue AtGBPL3 was identified as a novel component of the plant lamina, with essential functions in mitotic nuclear envelope reformation. AtGBPL3 is preferentially expressed in mitotically active root tips, accumulates at the nuclear envelope and interacts with further components of the nuclear lamina.

PRJNA922534	The vacuolar sugar transporter EARLY RESPONSE TO DEHYDRATION 6-LIKE4 regulates fructose signaling and plant growth (thale cress)	"Regulation of intracellular sugar homeostasis is maintained by regulation of activities of sugar import and export proteins residing at the tonoplast. We show here that the EARLY RESPONSE TO DEHYDRATION6-LIKE4 protein, being the closest homolog to the proton/glucose symporter ERDL6, resides in the vacuolar membrane. Gene expression and subcellular fractionation studies indicated that ERDL4 was involved in fructose allocation across the tonoplast. Overexpression of ERDL4 increased total sugar levels in leaves, due to a concomitantly induced stimulation of TST2 expression, coding for the major vacuolar sugar loader. This conclusion is supported by the finding that tst1-2 knockout lines overexpressing ERDL4 lack increased cellular sugar levels. ERDL4 activity contributing to the coordination of cellular sugar homeostasis is also indicated by two further observations. Firstly, ERDL4 and TST genes exhibit an opposite regulation during a diurnal rhythm, and secondly, the ERDL4 gene is markedly expressed during cold acclimation representing a situation in which TST activity needs to be upregulated. Moreover, ERDL4-overexpressing plants show larger size of rosettes and roots, a delayed flowering time and increased total seed yield. Consistently, erdl4 knock-out plants show impaired cold acclimation and freezing tolerance along with reduced plant biomass. In summary, we show that modification of cytosolic fructose levels influences plant organ development and stress tolerance.

PRJNA925827	pGlcT2, a new chloroplast glucose transporter that affects adaptation to extended light periods (thale cress)	"Intracellular sugar compartmentation is critically involved in plant development and acclimation to challenging environmental conditions. Sugar transport proteins are present in the plasma mem­brane and in membranes of organelles such as vacuoles, the Golgi apparatus and plastids. Here we report on a novel transporter of the Monosaccharide Transporter Family (MSF), that is the closest phylogenetic homolog to the chloroplast-localized glucose transporter pGlcT and that we therefore term plastidic glucose transporter 2 (pGlcT2). Its gene complemented glucose uptake deficiency of an Escherichia coli ptsG/manXYZ mutant strain and biochemical characterization revealed that this transporter specifically facilitates glucose transport, whereas other sugars do not serve as substrates. pGlcT2-GFP fusions located to the chloroplast envelope, and promoter activity analyses indicated that pGlcT2 is mainly produced in seedlings and in the rosette center of mature Arabidopsis plants. In the absence of additional sugars, pGlcT2-overexpression lines exhibited impaired germi­nation. In conjunction with molecular and metabolic data we propose that pGlcT2 acts as a glucose importer that can limit cytosolic glucose availability in developing pGlcT2-overexpressing seedlings. Overexpression, as well as deletion of pGlcT2 resulted in impaired growth efficiency under long day and especially under continuous light conditions, suggesting that pGlcT2 contributes to a release of glucose derived from starch mobilization late in the light phase. These data thus indicate that the facilitator pGlcT2 changes its direction of glucose transport during plant development and suggest that the activity of pGlcT2 must be controlled spatially and temporarily, in order to prevent developmental defects during adaptation to periods of extended light.

PRJDB12424	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Epigenetic regulation of ecotype-specific expression of a heat-activated transposon	Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile genes that are conserved in a wide variety of organisms, but the diversity of their activation has not been well studied. In this study, we analyzed the diversity in the transcriptional level of a retrotransposon called ONSEN, which is activated by high temperature stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the transcript level of ONSEN is significantly higher in the Japanese ecotype, Kyoto. Since transposons are epigenetically regulated, DNA methylation levels were analyzed, and revealed that CHH methylation was reduced in Kyoto compared to the standard ecotype, Col-0. A mutation was found in the sequence of CMT2, a CHH methyltransferase in Kyoto. This suggests that the mutation of CMT2 is the responsible for the high expression of ONSEN in Kyoto. CHH methylation forms a feedback loop with histone modifications to complement each other's modifications. Analysis of the histone modifications revealed that H3K9me2, a repressive histone mark for gene expression, was decreased in Kyoto compared to Col-0. Furthermore, another repressive histone mark, H3K27me1, was also decreased, but not in the cmt2 mutant of Col-0. Therefore, in addition to the CMT2 mutation, there may be other factors that reduce repressive histone modifications in Kyoto. Less...

CCA1 and LHY are Myb-like transcription factors, which bind to the evening element (EE) to regulate the expression of evening-expressed genes PSEUDORESPONSE REGULATOR 7 (PRR7), PRR5, and TIMING OF CAB EXPRESSION1 (TOC1).

PRJDB15134	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Expression profiles in knock-down transgenic plants of high and low diversified duplicates in Arabidopsis thaliana	Duplicated genes comprise a various degree of functional diversification in plants. Previously, we identified 1,052 and 600 pairs of high and low diversified duplicates in Arabidopsis thaliana, respectively. Furthermore, we found single knock down of high diversified duplicates induces abnormal phenotypic change, while single knock down of low diversified duplicate does not induce abnormal phenotypic change due to functional compensation in the copy gene. Here, focusing on our identified two pairs of high and low diversified duplicates, we performed transcriptome analyses in each of knock down transgenic plants. Much of differential expressed genes from wild types were identified in knock down transgenic plants of both high and low diversified duplicates. Thus, functional compensation inferred by transcriptomics was similar in between high and low diversified duplicates. However, the trend of differentially expressed genes tend to be similar in a pair of low diversified duplicates but the similarity of expression profile was not observed in a pair of high diversified duplicates. This result suggests that a pair of low diversified duplicates tends to share similar functions but a pair of high diversified duplicates tends to undergo functional differences. We concluded that both high and low diversified duplicates play independent roles but the functional differences are quite low in a pair of low diversified duplicates. Less...

PRJEB53956	Insertional polymorphisms of Inverted-Repeated sequences near coding genes shape chromatin topology and phenotypic traits in plants	"Transposons are mobile elements in the eukaryotic genomes that are commonly silenced to protect genome integrity. In plants, transposable elements (TEs) can be reactivated during stress conditions, inserted into gene-rich regions, and trigger adaptative changes. TE-derived inverted repeated (IR) sequences are commonly detected near genes in plants, affect hosting gene expression and were proposed as essential elements during adaptation. However, the molecular mechanisms by which these IRs control gene expression is unclear in most cases. Here, we identified hundreds of IR near genes in the Arabidopsis thaliana genome that the RNAPII transcribes to produce 24 nt small RNAs that trigger the methylation of the IR coding region. The expression of these IR is associated with drastic changes in the local 3D chromatin organization, which alter the expression pattern of the hosting genes.
We found numerous insertional polymorphisms within the identified IRs between Arabidopsis ecotypes. Capture-C sequencing experiments revealed that such variation in the IR content produces changes in short-range chromatin interaction that translate into specific gene expression patterns. Furthermore, CRISPR/CAS9-mediated disruption of IR not only leads to a switch in the genome topology and gene expression but also impacts the plants' phenotype. Altogether our data demonstrate that the insertion of an IR near a gene during evolution provides an anchor point for chromatin interactions that profoundly impact the hosting loci activity. This turn IRs into powerful elements with the potential to produce quick and drastic adaptative changes. Less..."

PRJEB52795	Plant Mobile Domain proteins are required for Microrchidia 1 expression to fulfil transposon silencingComplex interplay between Plant Mobile Domain and Microrchidia silencing pathways	Silencing of transposable elements (TEs) is an essential process to maintain genomic integrity within the cell. In Arabidopsis, together with canonical epigenetic pathways such as DNA methylation and modifications of histone tails, the plant mobile domain (PMD) proteins MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) and MAIN-LIKE 1 (MAIL1) are involved in TE silencing. Additionally, the MICRORCHIDIA (MORC) ATPases, including MORC1 are important cellular factors repressing TEs. Here, we describe the genetic interaction and connection between the PMD and MORC pathways by showing that MORC1 expression is impaired in main and mail1 mutants. This suggests that at least for a subset of TEs, silencing defects observed in pmd mutants could be the consequence of MORC1 downregulation. Transcriptomic analyses of higher-order mutant plants combining pmd and morc1 mutations as well as pmd mutants in which MORC1 expression is restored confirm this hypothesis. Thus, TE silencing defects observed in the pmd main and mail1 mutants can be partially explained by MORC1 downregulation. Less...	
PRJEB58994	SPATULA target genesIdentification of SPATULA target genes in Arabidopsis using RNA-seq	The bHLH transcription factor SPATULA (SPT) has been identified as a regulator during different stages of Arabidopsis development, including the control of leaf size. However, the mechanism by which it performs this function has not been elucidated. To understand better the role of SPT during leaf development, we used a transcriptomic approach to identify putative target genes. We found putative SPT target genes related to leaf development, and to stomata and trichome formation. Furthermore, genes related to anthocyanin biosynthesis. In this work, we demonstrate that SPT is a negative regulator of stomata number and a positive regulator of trichome number. In addition, SPT is required for sucrose-mediated anthocyanin biosynthesis. Less...	
PRJEB52103	Glutathione-mediated plant response to high-temperatureGenome-wide gene expression analyses indicate, that while the glutathione deficient cad2 mutant shares most common response to heat temperature with wild-type plants, it also shows deviations in the response which might participate to the sensitivity of the cad2 mutant to both high temperature regimes.	Climate change induce global warming and intense heat waves that affect plant development and productivity. Among the molecular perturbations that high temperature induces in living cells is the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage macromolecules of the cell and perturb the cellular redox state. To cope with deleterious effects of ROS, plant, as other organisms, have developed strategies to scavenge ROS and to regulate their redox state. Among those, glutathione plays a major role in maintaining the cellular redox state and the function of key antioxidant enzymes like peroxidases. Here, we investigated the contribution of the redox systems in plant adaptation to high temperature. We studied two different high temperature regimes: a rise of ambient temperature to 27°C inducing a plant developmental adaptation program called thermomorphogenesis, and a 37°C treatment mimicking intense heat wave and affecting plant viability. Using the genetically encoded redox marker roGFP, we show that high temperature regimes lead to cytoplasm and nuclear oxidation and impact profoundly the glutathione pool rather than the glutathione redox state. Moreover, plant can restore the pool within a few hours, which likely contribute to plant adaptation to high temperature. However, conditional glutathione deficient mutants fail to adapt to intense heat waves or to induce thermomorphogenesis, suggesting that glutathione is involved in both heat adaptation mechanisms. We also evaluate by RNAseq analyses, how plant change its genome expression signature upon heat stress and identified a marked genome expression deviation in mutant deficient in glutathione antioxidant which might contribute to its sensitivity to high temperature. Thus, we define glutathione as a major antioxidant molecule acting in the adaptation of plant to rise of temperature. Less...

PRJEB43904	DNA methylation profiling and analysis of differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of the Arabidopsis cells that received type-III effectors delivered by Xanthomonas campestris pv. Campestris (Xcc) bacterial mutants	Due to low numbers and poor accessibility of host cells that are targeted for effector delivery, the actual biological functions of most effectors remain elusive. Here, we developed a novel Isolation Nuclei TArgeted by Bacterial Effectors (INTABE) system, which facilitates selectively recovering nuclei of the cells in Arabidopsis thaliana plants that have received type-III effectors of pathogenic Xanthomonas bacteria.

PRJEB45855	Plant sigma factors and coldIntegration of low temperature and circadian signals by a higher plant sigma factor	Low temperatures cause widespread alterations in plant physiology and development. This has selected for the evolution of mechanisms that allow plants to sense, respond and acclimate to cold temperatures. Chloroplasts are a defining feature of plant cells and their metabolism is influenced by temperature. However, it is not known how information about low temperature conditions is communicated to chloroplasts. Here, we show that in Arabidopsis, a nuclear-encoded sigma factor (SIGMA FACTOR5, SIG5) regulates the expression of a chloroplast gene in response to cold, and this requires the bZIP transcription factors HY5 and HYH. The response of this pathway to cold is gated by the circadian clock. The pathway also underlies changes in the nuclear-encoded transcriptome that occur in response to low temperature. The mechanism enhances the tolerance of photosynthesis to long-term cold and impacts lipid remodelling, but does not confer freezing tolerance. We identify a mechanism that integrates low temperature and circadian signals, and communicates this information to chloroplasts to modulate the response of plants to low temperatures. Less...

PRJNA882195	The stability of ribonucleotide reductase is modulated by the E3 ubiquitin ligase PRL1	The evolutionarily conserved ribonucleotide reductase (RNR) catalyzes the reduction of ribonucleotides to deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), which are the building blocks for both DNA replication and DNA repair. Therefore, RNR is tightly regulated in all organisms. But it is still unknown how plants modulate RNR at post-translational level. The protein kinase ATR is a central regulator of replication stress responses. Through an activation tagging-based genetic screen, we found that overexpression of TSO2, a small subunit of the RNR, suppresses the hypersensitivity of Arabidopsis atr mutant to replication stress. Interestingly, TSO2 interacts with PRL1, which forms the Cullin4-based E3 ubiquitin ligase CRL4PRL1 and is negatively regulated by ATR. Further studies reveal that CRL4PRL1 ubiquitinates TSO2 at the lysine 295 and promotes its degradation via the 26S proteasome. Genetically, tso2 is epistatic to prl1 in response to replication stress. These results demonstrate that ATR inhibits PRL1 to enhance the stability of TSO2, not only providing novel insights into replication stress responses but also revealing new mechanisms of RNR, ATR, and PRL1.

PRJNA896364	The ATR-WEE1 module inhibits GCN20-GCN1 to promote the translation of SOG1 to activate replication stress responses	DNA replication stress seriously threatens genome stability and is a hallmark of cancers. The evolutionarily conserved kinase ATR and WEE1 are essential for the activation of replication stress responses, but the underlying mechanisms are not well-understood. Translational control is an important mechanism to regulate gene expression, but its roles in replication stress responses is largely unknown. Here we show that ATR-WEE1 controls the translation of SOG1, a master transcription factor required for replication stress responses in Arabidopsis. Through genetic screening, we find that loss of GCN20 or GCN1, which functions together to inhibit protein translation, suppresses the hypersensitivity of the atr or wee1 mutants to the replication stress. Biochemically, WEE1 inhibits GCN20 by phosphorylating GCN20, which is further polyubiquitinated and degraded. Ribosome profiling experiments reveal that loss of GCN20 enhances the translation efficiency of SOG1, while overexpression of GCN20 reduces it. In consistence, loss of SOG1 reduces the resistance of wee1 gcn20 to HU, and overexpression of SOG1 enhances the resistance to atr or wee1 to HU. These results suggest that ATR-WEE1 inhibits GCN20-GCN1 to promote the translation of SOG1 during replication stress. Taken together, our study uncovers a novel function of ATR-WEE1 and a new regulatory mechanism for SOG1, linking translational control to replication stress responses. Less...	
PRJNA755474	A high resolution single molecule sequencing-based Arabidopsis transcriptome using novel methods of Iso-seq analysis	BackgroundAccurate and comprehensive annotations of transcript sequences are essential for accuracy of quantification of gene and transcript expression for analysis of differential gene and transcript expression, and transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation. Single molecule long read technologies provide improved integrity of transcript structures including alternative splicing, transcription start and polyadenylation sites but accuracy is significantly affected by high sequencing errors.ResultsWe have generated a new and comprehensive Arabidopsis thaliana transcript reference dataset (AtRTD3) with extensive Iso-seq data from a range of plant material. We developed novel methods to determine splice junctions and transcription start and end sites accurately. Mis-match profiles around splice junctions provided a powerful and distinguishable feature between false and correct splice junctions allowing effective removal of falsely mapped splice junctions. Stratified approaches to remove transcript fragments due to degradation while taking account of expression abundance identified significant transcription start/end sites. The effectiveness of AtRTD3 was demonstrated by analysis of an RNA-seq time-series of plants exposed to cold which provided much higher resolution of transcript expression profiling and identified cold- and light-induced differential transcription start site and polyadenylation site usage.ConclusionsAtRTD3 is the most comprehensive, diverse and accurate Arabidopsis transcriptome available. It gives greater transcript quantification accuracy in RNA-seq data allowing detailed analysis of differential gene and transcript expression, alternative splicing and TSS and TES usage in Arabidopsis research. The novel methods for identifying splice junctions and transcription start/end sites are widely applicable and will improve single molecule sequencing analysis from any species. Less...

PRJNA836875	AGO1 and HSP90 buffer different genetic variants in Arabidopsis thaliana	Argonaute 1 (AGO1), the principal protein component of microRNA-mediated regulation, plays a key role in plant growth and development. AGO1 physically interacts with the chaperone HSP90 that buffers cryptic genetic variation in plants and animals. We sought to determine if genetic perturbation of AGO1 could also reveal cryptic genetic variation, and if so, whether AGO1-dependent loci would overlap with those dependent on Hsp90. To pursue these questions, we introgressed a hypomorphic mutant allele of AGO1 into a set of mapping lines derived from crosses of the commonly used Arabidopsis thaliana strains Col-0 and Ler. We found several instances in which this genetic perturbation buffered genetic variation; however, none of the AGO1-dependent loci overlapped with those buffered by HSP90 for the same traits. We focused on one buffered locus where AGO1 perturbation uncoupled the otherwise closely correlated traits days to flowering and rosette leaf number. Using a bulk segregant approach, we identified a non-functional Ler hua2 mutant allele as the causal AGO1-buffered polymorphism. Introduction of a non-functional hua2 allele in a Col-0 ago1 mutant background recapitulated the Ler-dependent ago1 phenotype, implying that coupling of these traits involves different molecular players in these closely related strains. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that even though AGO1 and HSP90 buffer genetic variation in the same traits, these robustness regulators interact epistatically with different genetic loci, suggesting that higher-level epistasis is uncommon. We also find evidence for rewiring of key regulatory pathways within the same species. Less...

PRJNA780518	Plants grow in lunar regolith (thale cress)	"The extent to which plants can enhance human life support on other worlds depends on the ability of plants to thrive in extraterrestrial environments using in situ resources. Using samples from Apollo 11, 12 and 17, we show that the terrestrial plant Arabidopsis thaliana germinates and grows in diverse lunar regoliths. However, our results show that growth is challenging; the lunar regolith plants were slow to develop, expressed genes indicative of ionic stresses, and many showed severe stress morphologies. Therefore, although in situ lunar regolith can be useful for plant production in lunar habitats, they are not benign substrates. The interaction between plants and lunar regolith will need to be further elucidated, and likely mitigated, to enable efficient use of lunar regolith for life support.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) was grown in lunar regolith from three different mission sites: Apollo 11, Apollo 12 and Apollo 17. The plants were grown completely within the regolith as a growth substrate and compared to plants grown in an identical fashion in a lunar simulant (JSC-1A) as the control. Comparisons between and among lunar regoliths, and the simulant controls, included morphology and development, and transcriptomic responses. Less..."

PRJNA813418	The receptor-like cytosolic kinase RIPK activates NADP-malic enzyme 2 to generate NADPH for fueling the ROS production (thale cress)	"Reactive oxygen species (ROS) production is a conserved immune response, primarily mediated in Arabidopsis by the respiratory burst oxidase homolog D (RBOHD), a nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADPH) oxidase associated with the plasma membrane. A rapid increase in NADPH is necessary to fuel RBOHD proteins and hence maintain ROS production. However, the molecular mechanism underlying the NADPH generation for fueling RBOHD remains unclear. In this study, we isolated a new mutant allele of flagellin-insensitive 4 (FIN4), encoding the first enzyme in de novo NAD biosynthesis. fin4 mutants show reduced NADPH levels and impaired ROS production. However, FIN4 and other genes involved in the NAD- and NADPH-generating pathways are not highly upregulated upon elicitor treatment. Therefore, we hypothesized that a cytosolic NADP-linked dehydrogenase might be post-transcriptionally activated to keep the NADPH supply close to RBOHD. RPM1-INDUCED PROTEIN KINASE (RIPK), a receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase, regulates broad-spectrum ROS signaling in plant immunity. We then isolated the proteins associated with RIPK and identified NADP-malic enzyme 2 (NADP-ME2), an NADPH-generating enzyme. Compared with wild-type plants, nadp-me2 mutants display decreased NADP-ME activity, lower NADPH levels, as well as reduced ROS production in response to immune elicitors. Furthermore, we found that RIPK can directly phosphorylate NADP-ME2 and enhance its activity in vitro. The phosphorylation of NADP-ME2 S371 residue contributes to ROS production upon immune elicitor treatment and the susceptibility to the necrotrophic bacterium, Pectobacterium carotovorum. Overall, our study suggests that RIPK activates NADP-ME2 to rapidly increase cytosolic NADPH, hence fueling RBOHD to sustain ROS production in plant immunity.

PRJNA814870	An environmentally-responsive transcriptional state modulates cell identities during root development (thale cress)	"Roots are fundamental organs for plant development and response to their environment: they anchor the plant to its growth substrate, uptake nutrients and water vital to plant growth, and can sense and respond to a variety of biotic and abiotic stresses. The architecture of root systems and their growth are known to be strongly affected by the environmental conditions found in the soil. However, the acquisition of cell identities at the root meristem is still mainly viewed as ontogenetically driven, where a small number of stem cells generate all the cell types through stereotyped divisions followed by differentiation, along a simple developmental trajectory. The extent to which environmental cues precisely shape and affect these developmental trajectories remains an open question. We used single-cell RNA-seq, combined with spatial mapping, to deeply explore the trajectories of cell states at the tip of Arabidopsis roots, known to contain multiple developing lineages. Surprisingly, we found that most lineage trajectories exhibit a stereotyped bifid topology with two developmental trajectories rather than one. The formation of one of the trajectories is driven by a strong and specific activation of genes involved in the responses to various environmental stimuli, that affects only of a subset of the cells in multiple cell types simultaneously, revealing another layer of patterning of cell identities in the root that is independent of cell ontogeny. We demonstrate the robustness of this environmentally-responsive transcriptional state by showing that it is present in a mutant where cell type identities are greatly perturbed, as well as in different Arabidopsis ecotypes. We also show that the root can adapt the proportion of cells that acquire this particular state in response to environmental signals such as nutrient availability. The discovery of this transcriptional signature further highlights the adaptive potential of plant development.

PRJNA817189	Comparison of the effect of induction of AtGDU1 and the constitutive over-expression of the AtGDU genes on the transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"The over-expression of the AtGDU genes in Arabidopsis leads to strong phenotypes, which have in common glutamine secretion by the hydathodes, increased amino acid export from seedlings, early senescence and lesions on the leaves, and small sized-plants. The goal of the study was (1) to describe the primary effects of the AtGDU1 overexpression on the transcriptome using a dexamethasone-inducible construct, and (2) to compare the transcriptomes of plants overexpressing AtGDU1 to AtGDU6, in order to identify the differences in the function of each of the genes.
Overall design: The 6Op-LHGRn system was used for inducible expression of AtGDU1. The AtGDU1 to AtGDU6 genes were expressed under the control of the CaMV 35S promoter in wild type Col plants. All lines were brought to homozygosity. All plants were grown in parallel on soil for 4 weeks in a growth chamber. Dex-GDU1 and parental 4c-S7 lines were sprayed with 100 µM dexamethasone and leaf samples were collected 7 and 25 hours after.

PRJNA818528	Evaluation the effects of ectopic expression of TaF5H1 in Arabidopsis driven by its native promoter on the the cell wall biosynthesis and salt tolerance by RNA-seq (thale cress)	"Purpose: The goals of this study are to compare the transcriptome of Arabidopsis seedlings expressing pTaF5H1:TaF5H1(expression of TaF5H1 driven by its native promoter) with the wild-type control(Col-0) under/without salt treatment, which may give us clues to whether and how cell wall composition changes affect salt tolerance.
Transcriptomes profiles of 14-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings of wild-type (Col-0) and  seedlings harbour pTaF5H1:TaF5H1 without and under NaCl treatment for 6 hours  were generated by RNA-seq, in triplicate, using Illumina a HiSeq instrument according to manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina, San Diego, CA, USA). Sequencing was carried out using a 2x150 paired-end (PE) configuration; image analysis and base calling was conducted by the HiSeq Control Software (HCS) + OLB + GAPipeline-1.6 (Illumina) on the HiSeq instrument. In order to remove technical sequences, including adapters, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) primers, or fragments thereof, and quality of bases lower than 20, pass filter data of fastq format was processed by Cutadapt (V1.9.1) to be high quality clean data. For mapping, firstly, reference genome sequences and gene model annotation files of relative species were downloaded  from ENSEMBL. Secondly, Hisat2 (v2.0.1) was used to index reference genome sequence. Finally, clean data were aligned to reference genome via software Hisat2 (v2.0.1). For expression analysis,  in the beginning, transcripts in fasta format are converted from known gff annotation file and indexed properly. Then, with the file as a reference gene file, HTSeq (v0.6.1) estimated gene and isoform expression levels from the pair-end clean data. For differential expression analysis, DESeq2 Bioconductor package was used, a model based on the negative binomial distribution, the estimates of dispersion and logarithmic fold changes incorporate data-driven prior distributions, Padj of genes were setted <0.05 to detect differential expressed ones.
Results: we mapped about 43.5 million sequence reads per sample to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10). Significant differential expressed genes(DEG) between samples was sreened for fold change≥2 and  p-value (fdr, padj)≤0.05.Totally 7713 significant DEGs were discovered with 3430 up -regulated and 4483 down-regulated, no significant  changes were detected as for the remaining 26505 genes among samples.
Conclusions:   Our study presents the detailed analysis of transcriptomes of Arabidopsis wild-type control(Col-0) and Arabidopsis seedlings expressing pTaF5H1:TaF5H1, with three biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our results show that ectopic expressing pTaF5H1:TaF5H1 in Arabidopsis changed the expression of some cell-wall related genes as well as genes related to salt stress response, inferring that changes in cell wall components may affect the salt tolerance of plants somehow.

Lateral root organogenesis is a key process in plant root system development and adaptation to the environment. To dissect the molecular events occurring during the early phase, we generated time-series transcriptomic datasets profiling lateral root development in puchi-1 and wild type backgrounds. Consistent with a mutually inhibitory mechanism, transcriptomic and reporter analysis revealed meristem-related genes were ectopically expressed during early stages of lateral root primordium formation in puchi-1.

PRJNA821422	Transcriptomic profiling of Arabidopsis primary root tips of brl3 mutant exposed to DNA damaging agent zeocin [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Brassinosteroids (BRs) are steroid hormones involved in multiple processes of plant growth and development, and the adaptation to the environment. Some of the processes regulated by BRs are meristem activity and stem cell divisions. At the core of the root stem cell niche, it is placed the quiescent center (QC), that act as a cell reservoir. QC cells only trigger their divisions when need to replenish the stem cells, for example, after a DNA damage. BR signaling is in charge of triggering these QC divisions, but the exact mechanisms of how this process is regulated is still unknown. Here, we use an interdisciplinary approach, using Arabidopsis thaliana as a model system, including molecular genetics, physiology and bioinformatics to decipher the role of BR receptors upon DNA damage regulating the QC divisions. The results uncover novel roles for the BR-receptor kinase BRL3 (BRI1-like 3) receptor in DNA damage response (DDR) in plants, by modulating the DNA repair and the cell-cycle progression. We identified candidate tissue-specific transcriptional regulator, specifically expressed in the QC cells, the RNR2A (RIBONUCLEOTIDE REDUCTASE 2A), in charge of maintaining dNTPs (deoxynucleotide triphosphates) supply during DNA synthesis that is modulated by BRL3 downstream signaling events. Considering the importance of plant stem cells and their tissues for biomass accumulation and constantly exposed to adverse environmental stresses that can cause DNA damage or cell-cycle arrest in the RAM, here we stablished the mechanism linking root meristematic activity to the DDR through the cell-specific steroid receptor kinase BRL3.

PRJNA821620	SHORT-ROOT Stabilizes PHOSPHATE1 to Regulate Phosphate Allocation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Coordinated distribution of Pi between roots and shoots is an important process that plants use to maintain Pi homeostasis. SHR (SHORT-ROOT) is well-characterized for its function in root radial patterning1-3. Here, we demonstrate a new role of SHR in controlling phosphate (Pi) allocation from roots to shoots by regulating PHOSPHATE1 (PHO1) in the root differentiation zone. We recovered a weak mutant allele of SHR in Arabidopsis which accumulates much less Pi in the shoot and shows constitutive Pi starvation response (PSR) under Pi-sufficient condition. Besides, Pi starvation suppresses SHR protein accumulation and releases its inhibition on the HD-ZIP Ⅲ transcription factor PHB. PHB accumulates and directly binds the promoter of PHO2 to upregulate its transcription, resulting in PHO1 degradation in the xylem-pole pericycle cells. Our findings reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism of how plants repress Pi translocation from roots to shoots in response to Pi starvation.

PRJNA825573	Strigolactone action in mitochondria triggers retrograde signaling for root growth modulation (thale cress)	"Strigolactones (SL) are a new class of plant hormones with a broad range of roles in symbiosis, germination and developmental regulation. The well-characterized signaling pathway for SL involves the canonical signaling component MAX2. Here we identified a novel, MAX2-independent SL signaling mechanism, which initiates in mitochondria, signals to the nucleus and regulates root development. By a forward genetic approach, we identified the SL-insensitive pig1 mutant, which altered the kinetic properties of the mitochondrial pyruvate dehydrogenase complex. SL has an unknown target in mitochondria, where it uncouples respiration. This leads to metabolic aberrations, mitochondria-to-nucleus retrograde signaling upregulating transcription of mitochondrial dysfunction genes and downregulating auxin-regulated genes. SL-triggered mitochondrial uncoupling is communicated to the nucleus via cleavage and translocation of the ER-localized transcription factor ANAC017. These observations establish a novel mechanism for SL signaling emanating from mitochondria and regulating development.

PRJNA827154	Modulation of Plant Development and Chilling Stress Responses by An Sm Core Protein Controlled Pre-mRNA Splicing in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Cold stress resulting from chilling and freezing temperatures substantially inhibits plant growth and reduces crop production worldwide. Tremendous research efforts have been focused on elucidating the molecular mechanisms of freezing tolerance in plants. Little is known about the molecular nature of chilling stress responses in plants. Here we found that two allelic mutants in a spliceosome component gene SmEb (smeb-1 and smeb-2) are defective in development and responses to chilling stress. RNA-seq analysis revealed that SmEb controls the splicing of many pre-mRNAs under chilling stress. The intron retentive COP1b splicing variant was dramatically induced by chilling stress in the smeb mutants. This nuclear-depleted COP1b lacks the nuclear speckle-localization capacity, supporting the regulatory role of COP1-HY5 interaction in hypocotyl elongation during chilling stress. Genetic evidence indicates that chilling-sensitive phenotype of the smeb mutants are partially rescued by the hy5 mutation. The transcription factor BES1 shows a dramatic defect in pre-mRNA splicing in the smeb mutants. Ectopic expression of the two BES1 splicing variants enhances the chilling sensitivity of the smeb-1 mutant. Biochemical and genetic analysis showed that CBFs act as negative upstream regulators of SmEb by directly suppressing its transcription. Together, our results demonstrate that proper alternative splicing of pre-mRNAs controlled by the spliceosome component SmEb is critical for plant development and chilling stress responses.

PRJNA828011	Dynamics of mRNA fate during light stress and recovery: from transcription to stability and translation (thale cress)	"The stability of mRNA is an important determinant of its abundance and, consequently, protein production. There has been extensive research on the pathways governing mRNA stability and translation, however, it is unclear the extent to which these processes are modulated by environmental conditions. We previously modelled rapid recovery gene down-regulation (RRGD) following light stress in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) using mathematical calculations to account for transcription in order to predict half-lives and led to the hypothesis of recovery-specific transcript destabilisation. Here, we test this hypothesis by quantifying changes in transcription, mRNA stability, and translation in leaves of mature Arabidopsis undergoing light stress and recovery and investigate processes regulating transcript abundance and fate. Compared to juvenile plants from prior work, here we find that stability is altered for a range of transcripts that encode proteins involved in post-transcriptional processes in mature leaves. We also observe transcript destabilisation during light stress, followed by re-stabilisation upon recovery. Alongside this, we observe fast transcriptional shut-off in recovery that, when paired with transcript destabilisation, promotes rapid down-regulation of stress-induced genes. Translation was dynamic over the course of light stress and recovery, with substantial transcript-specific increases in polysome loading observed during late stress independently of total mRNA abundance. Taken together, we provide evidence for the combinatorial regulation of transcription, mRNA stability, and translation that occurs during light stress and recovery.
Overall design: PolyA-enriched RNA-sequencing (mRNA-seq) was performed on Arabidopsis leaves infiltrated with cordycepin or mock [buffer only: 1 mM PIPES (pH 6.25), 1 mM sodium citrate, 1 mM KCl, 15 mM sucrose] harvested at 10, 20, 30, and 40 minutes post-infiltration under unstressed (US, 100 uE), high-light (HL, 1000 uE), and recovery conditions (Rec, 1000 ? 100 uE). The transcriptional inhibitor, cordycepin (3'-deoxyadenosine, Sigma-Aldrich), was syringe-infiltrated on the abaxial side of fully-expanded leaves (true leaves 4-6) of 21-day old plants. Individual leaves were infiltrated with 0.1 mL of incubation buffer [1 mM PIPES (pH 6.25), 1 mM sodium citrate, 1 mM KCl, 15 mM sucrose (Seeley et al. 1992)] with 0.6 mM cordycepin, or without (mock), using a 1 mL needleless syringe (Terumo). Excess liquid was removed from the leaf surface and plants were incubated for a minimum of 10 minutes before further treatment and harvesting. Light-stress was induced by increasing the light intensity to 10× growth irradiance (i.e. 1000 ?mol photons m-2 s -1), resulting in a ?hot high-light? treatment that effectively induces oxidative stress (Jung et al. 2013). For recovery, plants were returned to pre-stress light conditions. Each biological replicate was derived from leaves syringe-infiltrated, with either mock or cordycepin treatment, from the same plant at each time point per condition. Infiltrated leaves were excised, at the appropriate time point under each condition, from the base of the petiole and immediately flash-frozen, in a 2 mL safe-lock microcentrifuge tube (Eppendorf), using liquid nitrogen. Changes in polysome- and monosome-bound, and total-mRNAs were also profiled during the course of light stress and recovery. Plants were sampled at 0, 30, and 60 mins of high-light followed by 7.5, 15, and 30 mins of recovery (67.5, 75, 90 mins). Polysome profiling and mRNA-seq was performed in biological triplicate, consisting of multiple whole rosettes (250 mg) from independntly treated plants.

Here, we observed functional conservation of leaf senescence underlying pathways in A. thaliana, O. sativa, and S. lycopersicum. From machine learning-based integration of data from nearly 10 000 samples to obtain a universal regulatory network of leaf senescence, it was found that mitostasis is the cross-species central biological hub. We measure and compare changes in the transcriptome and metabolome of A. thaliana, O. sativa, and S. lycopersicum leaves under mitostress/natural senescence.

PRJNA832673	UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinases destabilize the CRY2 blue light receptor to regulate Arabidopsis growth (thale cress)	"Light is a crucial exogenous signal sensed by cryptochrome (CRY) blue light receptors to modulate growth and the circadian clock in plants and animals. However, how CRYs interpret light quantity to regulate growth in plants remains poorly understood. Furthermore, CRY2 protein levels and activity are tightly regulated in light to fine-tune hypocotyl growth; however, details of the mechanisms that explain precise control of CRY2 levels are not fully understood. We show that in Arabidopsis, UBP12 and UBP13 deubiquitinases physically interact with CRY2 in light. UBP12/13 negatively regulates CRY2 by promoting its ubiquitination and turnover to modulate hypocotyl growth. Growth and development were explicitly affected in blue light when UBP12/13 were disrupted or overexpressed, indicating their role alongside CRY2. UBP12/13 also interacted with and stabilized COP1, which is partially required for CRY2 turnover. Our combined genetic and molecular data support a mechanistic model in which UBP12/13 interact with CRY2 and COP1, leading to the stabilization of COP1. Stabilized COP1 then promotes the ubiquitination and degradation of CRY2 under blue light. Despite decades of studies on deubiquitinases, the knowledge of how their activity is regulated is limited. Our study provides insight into how exogenous signals and ligands, along with their receptors, regulate deubiquitinase activity by protein-protein interaction. Collectively, our results provide a framework of cryptochromes and deubiquitinases to detect and interpret light signals to control plant growth at the most appropriate time.

Dpe2/phs1 was reported to have a dwarf growth phenotype, an uneven starch distribution in the rosettes, and a strongly reduced starch granule number per chloroplast when grown under diurnal rhythm. Here we analyzed dpe2/phs1 in more detail and found that it showed three distinct growth periods. In young plants the starch granule number was similar to Col-0, then the starch granule number decreased massively down to one or no granule per chloroplast followed by an increase of the granule number. Thus, in dpe2/phs1 the control over the starch granule number is impaired and it is not defective in starch granule initiation. The data also show that the granule number is not fixed and is regulated over the entire plant growth. Further, also the chloroplasts revealed alterations during these three periods with a partially strong aberrant morphology in the middle phase. Interestingly, the unique metabolism perpetuated if starch degradation is further impaired by additionally lack of Isoamylase 3 and Starch excess 4. Transcriptomic studies and metabolic profiling of dpe2/phs1 revealed a gene co-regulation of most starch metabolism related genes and a clear metabolic separation. Further most senescence-induced genes were found to up-regulated more than 2-fold in the starch-less mature leave. Thus, dpe2/phs1 is a unique source to understand especially the starch granule number regulation in detail.
We performed gene expression profiling analysis using data obtained from RNA-seq of 3 stages from both Col-0 and dpe2/phs1.

PRJNA833204	Nodulin homeobox (NDX) is required for heterochromatin homeostasis in Arabidopsis [DRIP-seq] (thale cress)	"Nodulin homeobox (NDX) is a nuclear protein described as the regulator of specific euchromatic genes that controls multiple aspects of Arabidopsis development. At the molecular level, NDX was shown to i) interact with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to promote deposition of repressive histone marks at abscisic acid-responsive gene loci, and (ii) stabilize an R-loop structure within the Flowering Locus C (FLC) to control its expression. Herein, we aimed to understand the global role of NDX in chromatin-based gene regulation and comprehensively characterized its genomic binding sites and transcriptional relationships involving sRNA profiling, DNA methylation, and 3D chromatin structure. Using quantitative microscopic and genomics approaches we show that NDX is a highly immobile heterochromatic protein that localizes primarily to centromeres and pericentromeric regions. Most NDX binding sites coincide with heterochromatic sRNA loci that are known to mediate transcriptional gene silencing via the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. NDX localization was antagonistic with R-loop structures that were prevalent in euchromatic chromosomal arms. Functional analysis revealed that the absence of NDX led to differential hypo- and hyper-methylation in the CG / CHG / CHH sequence context, of which hypo-CHH / CHG sites were co-localized with NDX chromatin binding sites. The identified hypo-CHH/CHGs were associated with increased heterochromatic sRNA production (predominantly 24nt sRNAs) and parallel transcriptional activation of pericentric transposons. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) revealed significant chromatin structural changes in the ndx mutant, with decreased intra-chromosomal interactions (chromatin decompaction) at pericentromeric regions where NDX is enriched in wild type plants, and increased inter-chromosomal contacts between KNOT-forming regions. KNOT interactions involved de novo interchromosomal contacts similar to genome structural changes observed in DNA methylation mutants. We conclude that the main role of NDX is the functional regulation of heterochromatin, which is mechanistically coupled to the effector phase of the RdDM pathway.

PRJNA836283	Cap-binding complex assists RNA Polymerase II transcription in plant salt stress response (thale cress)	"Adaptive response to stress involves an extensive reprogramming of gene expression. Under stressful conditions, the induction of efficient changes in mRNA production is crucial for maximized plant survival. Transcription and pre-mRNA processing are two closely related steps in mRNA biogenesis, yet how they are controlled in plant stress response remains elusive. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis nuclear cap-binding complex (CBC) component CBP20 directly interacts with ELF7, a subunit of the transcription elongation factor RNA Pol II-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1c) to promote RNA Pol II transcription in plant response to salt stress. CBP20 and ELF7 co-regulate the expression of a large number of genes including those crucial for salt tolerance. Both CBP20 and ELF7 are required for enhanced RNA Pol II elongation at salt-activated genes. Though CBP20 also regulates intron splicing, this function is largely independent of ELF7. Our study reveals the function of an RNA processing regulator CBC in assisting efficient RNA Pol II transcription and pinpoints the complex roles of CBC on mRNA production in plant salt stress resistance.

PRJNA836542	Drug Delivery in Plants Using Silk Microneedles (thale cress)	"New systems for agrochemical delivery in plants will foster precise agricultural practices and provide new tools to study plants and design crop traits, as standard spray methods suffer from elevated loss and limited access to remote plant tissues. Silk-based microneedles can circumvent these limitations by deploying a known amount of payloads directly in plants’ deep tissues. However, plant response to microneedles’ application and microneedles’ efficacy in deploying physiologically relevant biomolecules are unknown. Here, we show that gene expression associated with Arabidopsis thaliana wounding response decreases within 24 hours post microneedles’ application. Additionally, microinjection of gibberellic acid (GA3) in A. thaliana mutant ft-10 provides a more effective and efficient mean than spray to activate GA3 pathways, accelerating bolting, and inhibiting flower formation. Microneedles’ efficacy in delivering GA3 is also observed in several monocot and dicot crop species, i.e., tomato (Solanum lycopersicum), lettuce (Lactuca sativa), spinach (Spinacia oleracea), rice (Oryza Sativa), maize (Zea mays), barley (Hordeum vulgare), and soybean (Glycine max).

PRJNA839398	DNA polymerase epsilon interacts with SUVH2/9 to mediate meiotic DSB associated gene silencing beyond DNA methylation in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Meiotic recombination is initiated from the SPORULATION 11 (SPO11)-triggered formation of double strand breaks (DSBs) that usually occur in open chromatin with active transcriptional features in many eukaryotes. However, gene transcription at meiotic DSB sites appears to be detrimental for repair, and the mechanisms for gene silencing at DSB sites are largely undefined, especially in plants. Here, we demonstrate that the largest DNA polymerase epsilon subunit POL2A interacts with SU(VAR)3-9 homologs SUVH2 and SUVH9. N-SIM (Structured Illumination Microscopy) observation shows that the colocalization of SUVH2 with meiotic DSB marker γ- H2AX is dependent on POL2A. RNA-seq of male meiocytes identifies that POL2A and SUVH2 jointly repress the expression of 865 genes, which have several known characteristics associated with meiotic DSB sites. Bisulfite-seq and small RNA-seq of male meiocytes support the idea that the silencing of these genes by POL2A and SUVH2/9 is likely independent of CHH methylation or 24-nt siRNA accumulation. Consequently, pol2a suvh2 suvh9 triple mutants have more severe defects in meiotic recombination and fertility compared with either pol2a or suvh2 suvh9. Taken together, our results not only identify a new epigenetic regulatory mechanism for gene silencing in male meiocytes, but also reveal new roles for DNA polymerase and SUVH2/9 beyond their classic functions in mitosis.

PRJNA842228	Auxin biosynthesis drives developmental reprogramming of differentiated cells (thale cress)	"Plant cells exhibit remarkable plasticity of their differentiation states, enabling regeneration of whole plants from differentiated somatic cells. How they revert cell fate and express pluripotency, however, remains unclear. In this study we demonstrate that transcriptional activation of auxin biosynthesis is crucial for reprogramming differentiated Arabidopsis leaf cells. We demonstrate that interfering with the activity of histone acetyltransferases dramatically reduces callus formation from leaf mesophyll protoplasts. Histone acetylation permits the transcriptional activation of PLETHORAs (PLTs), leading to the induction of their downstream target gene YUCCA1 (YUC1) encoding an enzyme for auxin biosynthesis. Auxin biosynthesis is in turn required to accomplish initial cell division through the activation of G2/M phase genes mediated by MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 3-RELATED (MYB3Rs). We further show that the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 3 (IAA3)/IAA18-mediated auxin signaling pathway is responsible for cell cycle reactivation by transcriptionally upregulating MYB3R4. These findings provide a mechanistic model of how differentiated plant cells revert their fate and reinitiate the cell cycle to become pluripotent.

PRJNA842249	CONSTANS and jasmonate signaling coordinate floral senescence in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Photoperiodic floral initiation in the leaf is controlled by the hub gene CONSTANS (CO) while jasmonates (JAs) control flower senescence. Although both processes are chronologically ordered, no association between them has been described to date. We show that CO protein remains in Arabidopsis flowers after the floral induction, although displaying a different tissue and diurnal pattern than in leaves. We found that changes in CO expression alter flower senescence and abscission by interfering with the JA response, supported by petal specific analysis as well as CO overexpression in JA synthesis and signaling mutants. CO has a ZIM-like domain that mediates interaction with the JA response repressor JAZ3 (jasmonate ZIM-domain 3), inhibiting its repressor activity and activating downstream transcription factors involved in flower senescence. The complex CO-JAZ3 also interacts with the E3 ubiquitin ligase Coronatine Insensitive 1 (COI1) leading to its degradation in the presence of jasmonates. Therefore, the coordinated recruitment of photoperiodic and jasmonate signaling pathways would be an efficient way for plants to chronologically order the floral process and ensure the success of offspring production.

PRJNA843780	The TRIPLE PHD FINGERS proteins are required for SWI/SNF complex-mediated +1 nucleosome positioning and transcription start site selection in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"In eukaryotes, DNA is associated with histones to form nucleosomes, the basic component of the chromatin. This structure presents a physical barrier for nuclear proteins to access DNA and, therefore, its plays a critical role in multiple processes such as transcription, replication and repair. Eukaryotes have evolved multiple chromatin remodelers to control nucleosome position and composition like the SWI/SNF family, which has been studied in detailed in diverse model organisms. We recently uncovered an evolutionarily conserved SWI/SNF complex in plants reminiscent of the mammalian BAF subclass, which incorporates the ATPases MINU and signature subunits TPF. In this study we characterize the impact of TPF depletion in the model plant Arabidopsis and we explore the genomic targets of the BAF complex, as well as its impact on nucleosome position and gene expression. Our results show that TPF mutants have strong developmental phenotypes, suggesting an important role in the complex function. TPF and MINU genomic targets show change in the position of the +1 nucleosome towards the promoter when the complex is mutated. While there is little correlation between this shift and changes in gene expression levels, we find a strong correlation between +1 nucleosome shift and the presence of extended 5´ regions towards the promoter in hundreds of BAF targets, suggesting a change in TSS usage. These additional 5´ UTR regions might alter RNA function and be responsible for the strong developmental phenotypes observed in the TPF and MINU mutants.

Although genome-wide profiling of RNA decay fragments is now feasible, how XRNs shape the plant mRNA degradome remains elusive. Here, we profiled and analyzed the RNA degradomes of the Arabidopsis wild type and mutants with defects in XRN activity. Deficiency of nuclear XRN3 or cytoplasmic XRN4 but not nuclear XRN2 activity largely altered Arabidopsis mRNA decay profiles. In addition to the primary XRN4 substrates derived from decapping and microRNA-directed slicing, terminating ribosome- and exon junction complex-protected fragments produced from XRN4-mediated cytoplasmic decay also represent the most abundant decay intermediates of Arabidopsis mRNAs. Short excised linear introns and cleaved pre-mRNA fragments downstream of polyadenylation sites were polyadenylated and stabilized in the xrn3 mutant, demonstrating the function of XRN3 in the removal of cleavage remnants from pre-mRNA processing. Further analysis of stabilized XRN3 substrates confirmed that polyadenylation cleavage frequently occurs after an adenosine. An increase in decay intermediates with 5′ ends upstream of a consensus motif in the xrn4 mutant suggests an endonucleolytic cleavage mechanism targeting the 3′ untranslated region of many Arabidopsis mRNAs. However, analysis of decay fragments stabilized in the xrn4 mutant indicated that, except for microRNA-directed slicing, endonucleolytic cleavage events in the coding sequence might rarely result in major decay intermediates. Together, the results of this study reveal major substrates and products of nuclear and cytoplasmic XRNs along Arabidopsis transcripts and provide a basis for precise interpretation of RNA degradome data.

We show that CONSTANS (CO/B-BOX PROTEIN1 BBX1), a master flowering regulator, forms a trimer with Arabidopsis thaliana NF-YB2/NF-YC3 to efficiently bind the CORE element of the FLOWERING LOCUS T promoter.
Using saturation mutagenesis, electrophoretic mobility shift assays, and RNA-sequencing profiling of co, nf-yb, and nf-yc mutants, we identify CCACA elements as the core NF-CO binding site.

PRJNA851769	COMPASS complexes redundantly regulate gene expression and DNA methylation in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The evolutionally conserved COMPASS complexes are responsible for the catalyzation of H3K4 methylations. Recently, three types of COMPASS complexes which contains histone methyltransferases ATX1/2, ATX3, or ATX4/5 were identified in Arabidopsis. Here, we report the ATX proteins are essential for the survival of Arabidopsis. By RNA-seq and chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) analysis, we found ATX1/2-, ATX3-, and ATX4/5-containing COMPASS complex redundantly regulate gene expression and H3K4me3 modifications. In addition to the developmental-related genes, we found the expression of DNA methylation-related genes were also regulated by the COMPASS complexes. The transcript and H3K4me3 levels at the RdDM pathway genes (NRPE1, DCL3, IDN2, FDM2) and at the DNA demethylase encoding genes (ROS1, DML2, DML3) were down-regulated in atx1/2/4/5 mutants. Via bisulfate sequencing, we found the atx1/2/4/5 showed hypermethylation at CG and CHG contexts whereas the hypomethylation at CHH contexts. By comparing the differentially methylated regions (DMRs) in atx1/2/4/5 with that in ros1;dml2;dml3 (rdd) and in nrpe1, a large part of overlapping DMRs were identified. Based on these results and other findings, we propose that the hypermethylation in CG and CHG is partially caused by the down-regulation of ROS1/DML2/DML3, and the hypomethylation in CHH is mainly caused by the down-regulation of NRPE1. Furthermore, we revealed that the COMPASS complexes also play a redundant role in regulating the transcription of transposable elements (TEs).

PRJNA852347	Regulatory functions of cellular energy sensor SnRK1 for nitrate signaling through NLP7 repression (thale cress)	"Coordinated metabolism of carbon and nitrogen is essential for optimal plant growth and development. Nitrate is an important molecular signal for plant adaptation to changing environmental conditions, but how nitrate regulates plant growth under carbon deficiency conditions remains unclear. Here, we show that the evolutionarily conserved energy sensor SnRK1 negatively regulates the nitrate signaling pathway. Nitrate promoted plant growth and downstream gene expression, but such effects were significantly repressed when plants were grown under carbon deficiency conditions. Mutation of KIN10, the α-catalytic subunit of SnRK1, partially suppressed the inhibitory effects of carbon deficiency on nitrate-mediated plant growth. KIN10 phosphorylated NLP7, the master regulator of nitrate signaling pathway, to promote its cytoplasmic localization and degradation. Furthermore, nitrate depletion induced KIN10 accumulation, whereas nitrate treatment promoted KIN10 degradation. Such KIN10-mediated NLP7 regulation allows carbon and nitrate availability to control the optimal nitrate signaling and ensures the coordination of carbon and nitrogen metabolism in plants.
Overall design: To determine whether KIN10 is involved in nitrate signaling to regulate downstream gene expression,we performed the RNA-sequencing (RNA-Seq) experiments with the roots of wild-type and KIN10 overexpression plants that were grown on MGRL medium containing 5 mM nitrate for 7 days, subjected to nitrogen-free medium for 2 days, and then treated with 5 mM KCl or 5 mM KNO3 for 1 h.

Method: RNA-Seq was performed on 7 day old roots (4d +Fe then transferred for 3d - Fe) of cell specific localization lines (WT;+ iron, WT,  pye-1, PPL, SHR23, PEP45, WER13, WER65) - triplicates. RNA was extracted using RNAeasy Plant RNA Purification Kit (Qiagen). cDNA synthesis and amplification were performed using the NEBNext® Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module followed by the NEBNext® Ultra™ II Directional RNA Library Prep and NEBNext® Multiplex Oligos for Illumina® (Index Primers Set 1) and sequenced using an Illumina HiSeq 2500 sequencing machine, with 125bp single end reads. Adapters and low quality reads were filtered out using fastQC and fastq-mcf. Clean reads were mapped against the TAIR 10 reference genome using the tophat2. RPKM were acquired using RSubread, followed by edgeR to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs), using a maximum false discovery rate (FDR) of 0.05 and minimum log fold change threshold of 0.75.
Results: We identified 4414 DEGs between WT (+iron) and WT (-iron). WT minus was used as the baseline to compare transcriptome landscape between cell specific localization lines.

PRJNA857316	Nodulin homeobox (NDX) is required for heterochromatin homeostasis in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Nodulin homeobox (NDX) is a nuclear protein described as the regulator of specific euchromatic genes that controls multiple aspects of Arabidopsis development. At the molecular level, NDX was shown to i) interact with the Polycomb repressive complex 1 (PRC1) to promote deposition of repressive histone marks at abscisic acid-responsive gene loci, and (ii) stabilize an R-loop structure within the Flowering Locus C (FLC) to control its expression. Herein, we aimed to understand the global role of NDX in chromatin-based gene regulation and comprehensively characterized its genomic binding sites and transcriptional relationships involving sRNA profiling, DNA methylation, and 3D chromatin structure. Using quantitative microscopic and genomics approaches we show that NDX is a highly immobile heterochromatic protein that localizes primarily to centromeres and pericentromeric regions. Most NDX binding sites coincide with heterochromatic sRNA loci that are known to mediate transcriptional gene silencing via the RNA-dependent DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. NDX localization was antagonistic with R-loop structures that were prevalent in euchromatic chromosomal arms. Functional analysis revealed that the absence of NDX led to differential hypo- and hyper-methylation in the CG / CHG / CHH sequence context, of which hypo-CHH / CHG sites were co-localized with NDX chromatin binding sites. The identified hypo-CHH/CHGs were associated with increased heterochromatic sRNA production (predominantly 24nt sRNAs) and parallel transcriptional activation of pericentric transposons. Chromosome conformation capture (Hi-C) revealed significant chromatin structural changes in the ndx mutant, with decreased intra-chromosomal interactions (chromatin decompaction) at pericentromeric regions where NDX is enriched in wild type plants, and increased inter-chromosomal contacts between KNOT-forming regions. KNOT interactions involved de novo interchromosomal contacts similar to genome structural changes observed in DNA methylation mutants. We conclude that the main role of NDX is the functional regulation of heterochromatin, which is mechanistically coupled to the effector phase of the RdDM pathway.

PRJNA858665	Establishing a reproducible approach to study cellular functions of plants cells with 3D bioprinting (thale cress)	"Capturing cell-to-cell and cell-to-environment signals in a defined 3 dimensional (3D) microenvironment is key to study cellular functions, including cellular reprogramming towards tissue regeneration. A major challenge in current culturing methods is that these methods cannot accurately capture this multicellular 3D microenvironment. In this study, we established the framework of 3D bioprinting with plant cells to study cell viability, cell division, and cell identity. To investigate the cellular reprogramming underlying the initial cell divisions prior to microcallus formation, we collected RNA from isolated differentiated root cells immediately, 1, and 3 days after bioprinting. We showed the cell cycle re-entry of the isolated Arabidopsis and soybean cells leading to the formation of microcalli and of which the timing coincides with the induction of core cell cycle genes and regeneration-related genes. Finally, we showed that the identity of isolated cells of Arabidopsis roots expressing endodermal markers maintained longer periods of time. The framework established in this study paves the way for a general use of 3D bioprinting for studying cellular reprogramming and cell cycle re-entry towards tissue regeneration.
Overall design: For the expression profiles, we collected RNA from bioprinted constructs and isolated cells (as a control) from meristematic and differentiated Arabidopsis thaliana root tissue.  We performed three independent experiments. Less..."

PRJNA858805	Titanium nanoparticles activate a transcriptional response in Arabidopsis that enhances tolerance to low phosphate, osmotic stress and pathogen infection (thale cress)	"Titanium is a ubiquitous element with a wide variety of beneficial effects in plants, including enhanced nutrient uptake and resistance to pathogens and abiotic stresses. While there is numerous evidence supporting the beneficial effects that Ti fertilization give to plants, there is little information on which genetic signaling pathways the Ti application activate in plant tissues.  In this study, we utilize RNA-seq and ionomics technologies to unravel the molecular signals that Arabidopsis plants unleash when treated with Ti. RNA-seq analysis showed that Ti activates abscisic acid and salicylic acid signaling pathways and the expression of NUCLEOTIDE BINDING SITE-LEUCINE RICH REPEAT receptors likely by acting as a chemical priming molecule. This activation results in enhanced resistance to drought, high salinity, and infection with Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis. Ti also grants an enhanced nutritional state by upregulating the expression of multiple nutrient and membrane transporters and by modifying or increasing the production root exudates. Our results suggest that Ti might act similarly to the beneficial element Silicon in other plant species.

As a transcription factor, GTL1 has been implicated in diverse developmental roles. We hypothesized that GTL1 represses multiple drought tolerance pathways, leading to the drought tolerance phenotype of the gtl1-4 knockout mutant. RNA-Seq data indicates that GTL1 regulates genes involved in ribosome biogenesis in emerging leaves and secondary metabolite synthesis in expanding leaves.
Overall design: RNA was collected from emerging and expanding leaves of Col-0 wildtype Arabidopsis thaliana and the knockout mutant gtl1-4 that had been maintained under well-watered or a 30% media water content water-deficit stress.

How seed vigor is established in seeds is still poorly understood. Here, we report the crucial function of Arabidopsis histone variant H3.3 in chromatin structure regulation that endows seeds with post-embryonic developmental potentials. H3.3 is not essential for seed formation, but the loss of H3.3 results in severely impaired germination and post-embryonic development.

PRJNA870499	Retrograde Control of Cytosolic Translation Targets Synthesis of Plastid Proteins and Nuclear Responses for High-Light Acclimation. (thale cress)	"Canonical retrograde signalling comprises information transmission from organelles to the nucleus and in particular controls gene expression for organellar proteins. The need to re-assess this paradigm was suggested by discrepancies between de novo protein synthesis and transcript abundance in response to excess light. Here we uncover major components of a translation-dependent retrograde signalling pathway that first impacts translation and then transcription. The response realization depends on the kinases Mitogen-activated protein kinase 6 (MPK6) and Sucrose non-fermenting 1-related kinase (SnRK1) subunit, AKIN10. Global ribosome foot-printing revealed differential ribosome association of 951 transcripts within 10 min after transfer from low to high light. Despite predominant translational repression, 15 % of transcripts were increased in translation and enriched for chloroplast-localized photosynthetic proteins. About one third of these transcripts, including Stress associated proteins (SAP) 2 and 3, share regulatory motifs in their 5`-UTR that act as binding sites for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPC) and light responsive RNA binding proteins (RBPs). SAP2 and 3 are both translationally regulated and interact with the calcium sensor Calmodulin-like 49 (CML49), which promotes relocation to the nucleus inducing a translation-dependent nuclear stress response. Thus, translation-dependent retrograde signalling bifurcates to directly regulate a translational circuit of chloroplast proteins and simultaneously initiate a nuclear circuit synchronizing retrograde and anterograde response pathways, serving as a rapid mechanism for functional acclimation of the chloroplast.
Overall design: Ribosome protected fragment (RPF)-sequencing and total RNA sequencing was performed on whole Arabidopsis rosettes from plants plants grown under low-light (LL) (8µE) or 10 min of LL to high light (HL) (800µE) treated. 3 g of pulverized plant material was used with 6 mL polysomal extraction buffer (PEB; 0.2 M Tris, pH 9.0, 0.2 M KCl, 25 mM EGTA, 35 mM MgCl, 1 % Brij, 1 % Triton X-100, 1 % Tween 20, 1 % Igepal CA630, 1% sodium deoxycholate (DOC), 1 % polyethylene-10-tridecylether (PTE), 5 mM DTT, 1 mM PMSF, 100 µg/mL cycloheximide, 100 µg/mL chloramphenicol, 100 µg/mL lincomycin).

RNase If digest was performed with 2,000 relative absorbance units OD260 of the in RNase digestion buffer suspended polysomes by adding 50 U of RNase If (New England Biolabs) in 250 µL total volume by incubation at room temperature with constant rotation for 1 h. In parallel same amounts of polysomes were treated with 5 µL SUPERase RNase inhibitor (Thermo) and kept on ice as control sample. The digestion was stopped by adding 5 µL SUPERase RNase inhibitor and the RNA precipitated by adding 1 volume of isopropanol, 300 mM NaOAc pH 5.2 and 20 µg glycogen at -80 over-night. The supernatant was discarded after centrifugation at 16,000 xg at 4 °C for 30 min and the sediment was washed twice with 75 % ethanol and resuspended in RNA loading buffer for size exclusion electrophoresis.  Total RNA was isolated using Tri Reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) from extracts suspended in polysomal extraction buffer (see sucrose cushion for polysome isolation, above). Briefly, 500 µL of extract was combined with 1 mL of TriReagent, followed twice by extraction of the organic phase with 200 µL chloroform.

PRJNA872527	Global co-function network of plant autophagy pathway (thale cress)	"Autophagy is essential for plant response to a variety of developmental and environmental factors. However, unlike yeast and animals, only a few autophagy genes in plants are functionally conserved in the biological world. An important question is, how plants form autophagy related functions in evolution? Here, we developed and verified a workflow that identified 997 high-confidence autophagy related genes (ARG) in A.thaliana using multi-group data from nearly 10,000 samples and established a co-network of autophagy containing 3,419 new presumptive connections. Of note, through the genomic analysis of 76 representative plants from lower to higher levels, we found that ARGs were preferentially retained after polyploidization followed by terrestrialization, forming plant-specific autophagy-related functions. In addition, we provide the evolutionary gains and losses of ARGs function in monocotyledons and dicotyledons, and verified two novel genes ml2 and ml5 presumed to be involved in autophagy and leaf senescence. This work provides valuable resources for the study of plant autophagy and highlights that ARGs may selectively promote the success of plant autophagy through polyploidy in the process of evolution.

PRJNA873867	Suppression of transposon mobilization by m6A-mediated RNA sequestration in stress granules	Transposon is a mobile and ubiquitous DNA that can vastly causes genomic alterations. In plants, it is well documented that transposon mobilization is strongly repressed by DNA methylation. however, the roles of RNA methylation in transposon control remain unknown. Here we suggest that transposon RNA is marked by m6A RNA methylation and is sequestered in stress granule in m6A-dependent manner. Intriguingly, a SG-localized AtALKBH9B selectively demethylates a heat-activated retroelement Onsen, and thereby releases from spatial confinement allowing for its mobilization. In addition, we show evidence that m6A RNA methylation contributes to transpositional suppression by inhibiting the virus-like particles assembly and extrachromosomal DNA production. In summary, this study unveils a hidden role for m6A in the suppression of transposon mobility and provides an insight into how transposon counteracts the host's epitranscriptomic control by hitchhiking RNA demethylase.

PRJDB9856	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Functional analysis of Mediator subunits involved in heat stress response	Mechanism of heat stress response in plants has been studied focusing on the function of transcription factors (TFs).

PRJDB13252	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Systemic Regulation of Iron Acquisition in Arabidopsis From Environments with Heterogeneous Iron Distributions	Nutrient distribution within the soil is generally heterogeneous. Plants therefore have evolved sophisticated systemic processes enabling them to optimize their nutrient acquisition efficiency. By organ-to-organ communication in Arabidopsis thaliana, for instance, iron starvation in one part of a root drives the upregulation of a high-affinity iron uptake system in another part of the root that is surrounded by sufficient levels of iron. This compensatory response through organ-to-organ communication includes the upregulation of Iron-regulated transporter 1 (IRT1) gene expression on the iron-sufficient side of the root, however, molecular mechanisms underlying this long-distance signaling remain unclear. Here, we analyzed gene expression by RNA-seq analysis of iron-starved split-root cultures. Genome-wide expression analysis showed that localized iron depletion in a root system upregulated several genes involved in iron uptake and signaling, such as IRT1, in a distant part of the root that was exposed to the iron-sufficient conditions. This result indicates that long-distance signaling for iron demand alters the expression of a subset of genes responsible for iron uptake and coumarin biosynthesis to maintain level of iron acquisition sufficient for the entire plant. Loss of IRON MAN /FE-UPTAKE-INDUCING PEPTIDE (IMA/FEP) leads to disruption of compensatory upregulation of IRT1 on the root that is surrounded by sufficient iron. In addition, our split-root culture-based analysis provides evidence that IMA3/FEP1-MYB10/72 pathway mediates long-distance signaling in iron homeostasis through the regulation of coumarin biosynthesis. These data suggest that the signaling of IMA/FEP, a ubiquitous family of metal-binding peptides, is critical for organ-to-organ communication in response to iron starvation under heterogeneous iron conditions in the surrounding environment.

PRJEB48542	RNAseq of Arabidopsis seedlings of either wt or hsl3-1, in response to a 30 minute treatment of 100 nM CTNIP4 relative to mock	In order to identify novel stress-induced signalling peptides, we searched for Arabidopsis thaliana transcripts encoding short proteins (<150 amino acids) with a predicted signal peptide, which were induced upon biotic elicitor treatment (Bjornson et al., 2021). Through this analysis, we identified an uncharacterised family of peptides with 5 predicted members, which we named CTNIP1 to 5 (pronounced catnip) based on relatively conserved residues within the peptides. CTNIP4 is perceived by Arabidopsis, inducing some hallmark outputs of defence (Pattern-Triggered Immunity) signalling. Mass spectrometric analyses indicated that HSL3 may be the receptor mediating CTNIP recognition. Through assaying transcriptomic responses in wild type and hsl3-1 mutants, we were able to confirm similarity of CTNIP and defence responses at the transcriptional level, and the dependence of these responses on HSL3.	
PRJEB53626	Effects of root-specific activation of plasma membrane H+-ATPase 1 on genome-wide gene expression in A. thaliana roots	Plasma membrane (PM) H+-ATPase contributes to nutrient uptake and stomatal opening by creating proton gradient across the membrane. A dominant mutation in the OPEN STOMATA2 locus (OST2-2D) constitutively activates Arabidopsis PM H+-ATPase 1 (AHA1), enlarging proton motive force for root nutrient uptake. However, the stomatal opening is also constitutively enhanced in the ost2-2D, which results in drought hypersensitivity. Therefore, we postulated that the root-specific activation of OST2/AHA1 could be an ideal design for improving nutrient uptake efficiency without causing drought hypersensitivity. Accordingly, we grafted Col-0 (WT) scions onto rootstock originating from WT or ost2-2D and analyzed the vegetative growth, nutrient element content, and transcriptomes of the grafted plants grown under nutrient-rich or -poor conditions.

PRJEB53656	undefinedeccDNA and structural variants analysis reveals massive genome instability in Arabidopsis epigenetic mutants	The epigenome controls transposable element (TE) mobility and mutants affected in the epigenetic machinery display active TEs associated with extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA). However, the interplay between eccDNA and genome stability is poorly understood. Here we show that Arabidopsis plants combining mutations in chromatin remodeling, post-transcriptional gene silencing and RNA-directed DNA methylation have a high eccDNA load associated with integration of truncated TEs and genome instability. We analyzed the eccDNA and genome sequence of ddm1 rdr6 pol4 (Decrease DNA methylation 1, RNA dependent RNA polymerase 6, RNA polymerase 4) triple mutant plants and uncovered TE mobility of full length and truncated TEs. Additionally, TE movement was associated with gene movement of a disease resistance cluster named RPP5. We further discovered a large 2 Mbp inversion and show that this inversion is also present in ddm1 single mutant plants, probably since its isolation 30 years ago. Finally, long read sequencing allowed the detection of two independent ~55 kb duplications in ddm1 siblings. Our results highlight the role of the epigenome in protecting the genome not only against TE mobility but also against chaotic genome rearrangements and eccDNA-driven gene chimerism. We propose that DDM1, on top of its indirect role on DNA methylation and TE control, has a role in protecting the genome against genomic rearrangements. Less...

PRJEB51363	Loss of U6 snRNA m6A modification reveals two major classes of pre-mRNA 5’ splice siteIllumina RNA sequencing of Col-0 and fio1-3 mutant Arabidopsis	Alternative splicing of messenger RNAs is associated with the evolution of developmentally complex eukaryotes. Splicing is mediated by the spliceosome, and docking of the pre-mRNA 5’ splice site into the spliceosome active site depends upon pairing with the conserved ACAGA sequence of U6 snRNA. In some species, including humans, the central adenosine of the ACAGA box is modified by N6 methylation, but the role of this m6A modification is poorly understood. Here we show that m6A modified U6 snRNA determines the accuracy and efficiency of splicing. We reveal that the conserved methyltransferase, FIO1, is required for Arabidopsis U6 snRNA m6A modification. Arabidopsis fio1 mutants show disrupted patterns of splicing that can be explained by the sequence composition of 5’ splice sites and cooperative roles for U5 and U6 snRNA in splice site selection. U6 snRNA m6A influences 3’ splice site usage and reinforces splicing fidelity at elevated temperature. We generalise these findings to reveal two major classes of 5’ splice site in diverse eukaryotes, which display anti-correlated interaction potential with U5 snRNA loop 1 and the U6 snRNA ACAGA box. We conclude that U6 snRNA m6A modification contributes to the selection of degenerate 5’ splice sites crucial to alternative splicing. Less...

PRJEB34948	Ath_mutants_FANSATACCapSeq_20170630_NextSeq500_PE_MidOutputStudy of Capture sequencing of Tn5 transposase accessible chromatin DNA libraries in Arabidopsis thaliana	Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) results in changes in gene transcript abundance. Previously, Jones Laboratory identified a list of ETI-specific early response genes (ERGs) at their transcript level through a time-course genome-wide RNAseq (Sohn et al. 2014 PLOS Genetics). We ask how the ERGs are regulated in ETI-specific manner, and what regulatory elements could be involved. Based on the literature, we selected several mutants (eds1-2[Col-0], rrs1-3 rrs1b-1, sard1 cbp60g, myc2 myc3 myc4, t) to test if the chromatin status ('open' or 'close', and transcription factor accessibilities) are directly associated with ERGs expressions upon ETI induction through Pf0-1 carrying AvrRps4 (ETI plus PAMP-triggered immunity [PTI]). The control plants are wild-type (WT) Col-0. The control treatments are untreated Col-0, mock treatment (10mM MgCl2) on all genotypes, and PTI alone (infiltration of Pf0-1 carrying AvrRps4 KRVY135-138AAAA mutant). We collected 2 leaves from each individual plant, and we collected 6 leaves from each genotype and each treatment at 4 hours post-infiltration. The OD600 of each Pf0-1 strains for infiltration is 0.2 in 10mM MgCl2. All plants were grown in a short-day controlled light chamber (JIC B5102). Every treatment and genotype have three biological replicates (3 batches of samples are collected on independent dates, and each batch contains one full set of samples from the WT and all selected mutants with all treatments. Leaves samples are directly ground in pre-cold nuclei isolation buffer (NIB). After 2M sucrose cushion in the NIB, nuclei pellets are resuspended in the resuspension buffer and stained with SYBR™ Green I Nucleic Acid Gel Stain, 10,000X concentrate in DMSO (ThermoFisher Scientific S7585) and sorted by the strength of GFP signal on Sony flow cytometry (cell sorter SH800). Approximately 1000 nuclei per sample are treated with Illumina Nextera Tn5 0.1uL enzyme in 5uL reaction mix at 37 degrees for half an hour. Tagmented nuclei samples are amplified by dual index primers designed by ourselves. Each library is barcoded with customer designed dual indexes (P5 and P7) with 9nt-index-nucleotide inserts. Post AMPure beads purification, the quality, and purity of the ATAC DNA libraries were tested through Bioanalyzer with Agilent DNA high sensitivity kit. Instead of genome-wide sequencing, we designed 120nt RNA bait libraries (http://www.mycroarray.com) to enrich the sequences from 52 genes of interests (ERGs and control genes) (capture sequencing or CapSeq). . Before the CapSeq, we mixed equal molar (pM) of each ATACseq libraries (only take the size between 200bp to 1000bp into the consideration of molar concentration) with different indexes. We spiked in 4 Col-0 genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries generated with Nextera kit as CapSeq control. The quantity of each gDNA library is 10-fold less than each cDNA library. Meantime, we also blend in sperm nuclei (3 replicates) and vegetative nuclei (3 replicates) FANSATAC samples from Dr. Xiaoqi Feng's lab. For the final mixture, our FANSATACCapSeq:'Xiaoqi's samples' molar ratio is 9:1, so we expect to see 90% reads are for our samples, 10% reads are for Xiaoqi's samples. Following the Standalone protocol from NextSeq, we used the 1.8pM final library as the input for sequencing. We used NextSeq® 500/550 Midi Output Kit v2 (150 cycles) (FC-404-2001) to perform the pair-end (PE) and dual-index RNAseq on the NextSeq 500 machine located in JIC. Less...

In Arabidopsis thaliana, TREHALOSE 6-PHOSPHATE SYNTHASE 1 (TPS1) and its product, trehalose 6-phosphate (T6P), are important for the metabolic control of plant development. tps1 mutants are embryo lethal and unable to flower when embryogenesis is rescued. T6P is believed to regulate development in part through inhibition of SUCROSE NON-FERMENTING1 RELATED KINASE1 (SnRK1).
Here, we explored the role of SnRK1 in T6P-mediated plant growth and development using a combination of a mutant suppressor screen and genetic, cellular and transcriptomic approaches.
We report non-synonymous amino acid substitutions in the catalytic KIN10 and regulatory SNF4 subunits of SnRK1 that can restore both embryogenesis and flowering of tps1 mutant plants. The identified SNF4 point mutations disrupt the interaction with the catalytic subunit KIN10.
Contrary to the common view that the two A. thaliana SnRK1 catalytic subunits act redundantly, we found that loss-of-function mutations in KIN11 are unable to restore embryogenesis and flowering, highlighting the important role of KIN10 in T6P signalling. Less..."

PRJNA853395	MYB59 transcription factor integrates age, salicylic acid, and jasmonic acid signals to inhibit leaf senescence	Leaf senescence is the final stage of leaf development, which is jointly affected by various exogenous and endogenous factors. Among them, salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA), and transcription factors are the key regulatory factors of leaf senescence, whereas the molecular mechanisms remain largely unclear. In this study, we found that the leaf senescence of myb59 mutant plants was significantly earlier than that of wild-type plants, and the compensatory lines under the background of myb59-1 plants restored the leaf senescence to wild-type level, which proved that MYB59 was a negative regulator of age-dependent leaf senescence. Expression pattern analysis showed that MYB59 was dominantly expressed in the rosette leaves at early senescence stage. RNA sequencing revealed that a large number of senescence-related genes were differentially expressed between wild-type and myb59-1 plants. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays and transient dual-luciferase reporter analysis demonstrated that MYB59 directly bound to SENESCENCE ASSOCIATED GENE 18 (SAG18) promoter and repressed its transcriptional activity. Moreover, MYB59 inhibited SA production by directly repressing ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE 1 (ICS1) and PHENYLALANINE AMMONIA-LYASE 2 (PAL2) expression and restrained JA biosynthesis by directly suppressing LIPOXYGENASE 2 (LOX2) expression. Application of exogenous SA, MeJA, and their inhibitors proved that MYB59 negatively regulated SA- and JA-mediated leaf senescence. These results help us to understand the novel function of MYB59 and provide new insights into the regulatory network of transcription factors controlling leaf senescence in Arabidopsis thaliana.

Transcriptome analysis revealed that miR9748 might mediate heat tolerance through plant hormone signal pathway. 5' RNA ligase-mediated rapid amplification of cDNA ends (5' RLM-RACE) and transient transformation technology demonstrated that CsNPF4.4 was the target gene of miR9748. CsNPF4.4 overexpression plants decreased the thermotolerance accompanied by reducing the content of jasmonic acid (JA), but alleviated by folia application of methyl jasmonate, indicating that CsNPF4.4 negatively regulated heat stress tolerance through inhibition JA signal pathway. Furthermore, heat stress also increased the expression level of CsbZIP2. Yeast one-hybrid and dual luciferase assays showed that CsbZIP2 directly bound to the promoter of MIR9748 to induce its expression. Taken together, our results indicated that CsbZIP2 directly regulated miR9748 expression to cleave CsNPF4.4 to mediate high temperature stress tolerance through JA pathway. Less...

PRJNA812776	Analyses of the transcriptional and alternative splicing changes in mdf-1 in comparison to WT via RNA sequencing (thale cress)	"Purpose: Understand the transcriptional changes and alternative splicing defects associated to the pleiotropic defects observed in mdf-1 mutants. Methods: Total RNA was extracted from 3 different biological replicates containing 12-day-old seedlings of WT and mdf-1 using the innuPREP Plant RNA kit (Analytik Jena Bio solutions). RNA quality assessment, library preparation, sequencing and bioinformatic analyses were performed by Novogene Co. Integrity and quantitation of the extracted RNA were measured using the RNA Nano 6000 Assay Kit of the Bioanalyzer 2100 system (Agilent Technologies, CA, USA). With 1 µg RNA per sample as input material, sequencing libraries were subsequently generated using NEBNext® UltraTM RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB) following the manufacturer’s recommendations. Index codes were also added to attribute sequences to each sample. Clustering of the index-coded samples was carried out on a cBot Cluster Generation System using PE Cluster Kit cBot-HS (Illumina) following manufacturer’s instructions. Afterwards, library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina NovaSeq 6000 platform and approximately 50 million 150 paired end reads per sample were generated. To ensure the high quality of the samples, only clean data was used for subsequent analyses. This was achieved after the removal of reads containing adapter and poly-N sequences and reads with low quality from the raw data. Mapping against the Arabidopsis TAIR10 reference genome was performed using the HISAT2 software. Reads Per Kilobase of exon model per Million mapped reads (RPKM) of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analyses between mdf-1 and WT were carried out using the DESeq2 R package with the Benjamini and Hochberg’s approach for adjusting P values according to the False Discovery Rate (FDR). Genes with adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered as differentially expressed. Alternative splicing (AS) analysis was performed with the rMATS software. Events with adjusted p-value < 0.05 were considered as alternatively spliced. Results: Loss of MDF function is associated with growth defects, impaired transition to mitosis, increased endoreduplication and spontaneous cell death in meristems.  This was associated with strong upregulation of stress-induced genes and down-regulation of mitotic regulators and a subset of genes required for essential developmental processes. MDF is also required for the correct splicing of numerous transcripts including transcription factors and cell cycle associated genes.

PRJNA749291	In vivo single-molecule RNA structure analysis reveals COOLAIR RNA structural diversity	We used the SHAPE reagent, 2 methylnicotinic acid to do the in vivo RNA secondary structure chemical probing. NAI was prepared as reported previously. Briefly, Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were completely covered in 20 mL SHAPE reaction buffer (100 mM KCl, 40 mM HEPES (pH7.5) and 0.5 mM MgCl2) in a 50 mL Falcon tube. NAI was added to a final concentration of 1 M and the tube swirled on a shaker (1000 rpm) for 15 min at room temperature (22 celsius) or 30 min at 4 Celsius. This high NAI concentration allows NAI to penetrate plant cells and modify the RNA in vivo. After quenching the reaction with freshly prepared dithiothreitol (DTT), the seedlings were washed with deionized water and immediately frozen with liquid nitrogen and ground into powder. Total RNA was extracted using hot phenol method, followed by DNaseI treatment in accordance with the manufacturer's protocol. The control group was prepared using DMSO (dimethyl sulfoxide, labeled as minus SHAPE), following the same procedure as described above. 2ug plus SHAPE or minus SHAPE RNA samples was added into 19 uL buffer system containing with 2 uL 0.5 uM RNA-DNA hybrid adaptors, 4 uL reaction buffer, and 1uL TGIRT-III III enzyme.The reaction system was pre-incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes, then 1 uL of 25 mM dNTPs (an equimolar mixture of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP at 25 mM each; RNA grade) added. The whole reaction system in the tube was incubated at 60 celsius for 120 minutes. To remove the TGIRT-III enzyme from the template, 1 uL of 5 M NaOH was added and incubated at 95 celsius for 3 minutes. The sample was cooled down to room temperature and neutralized with 1 uL of 5 M HCl before the clean-up of the cDNAs with a MinElute Reaction Cleanup Kit. To capture Class I and Class II COOLAIRs along with 18S rRNA, PCR reactions with 10 cycles were conducted with specific primers using KOD Xtreme Hot Start DNA Polymerase (Novagen). The amplified DNA fragments from the eight replicates of PCR reactions were merged for achieving sufficient DNAs. The resulting DNAs were size-selected by Solid Phase Reversible Immobilization (SPRI) size selection system (BECKMAN COULTER). Two independent biological replicates were generated for both plus SHAPE and minus SHAPE smStructure-seq libraries. The purified DNA samples were subjected to PacBio library construction by BGI company using PacBio Sequel 3.0. For HIV-1 RRE61 and tenA treatment, the details are in the manuscript. Less...

PRJNA786556	A sorghum genome-wide association study (GWAS) identifies a WRKY transcription factor as a candidate gene underlying resistance to sugarcane aphid (Melanaphis sacchari) - Heterologous expression of SbWRKY86 in Arabidopsis	Crop plant resistance to insect pests is based on genetically encoded traits which often display variability across diverse germplasm. In a comparatively recent event, a predominant sugarcane aphid (SCA: Melanaphis sacchari) clone has become a significant agronomic pest for grain sorghum (Sorghum bicolor) production. In an effort to uncover candidate genes underlying SCA resistance, we used a forward genetics approach combining the genetic diversity present in the Sorghum Association Panel (SAP) and the Bioenergy Association Panel (BAP) for a Genome Wide Association Study, employing an established SCA damage rating. Statistically significant single nucleotide polymorphisms were found on Chromosome 9 within the WRKY transcription factor 86 (SbWRKY86). Transcripts encoding SbWRKY86 were previously identified as upregulated in SCA-resistant germplasm and the syntenic ortholog in maize accumulates following Rhopalosiphum maidis infestation. Analyses of SbWRKY86 transcript levels displayed elevated levels in additional SCA resistant sorghum lines. Heterologous expression of SbWRKY86 in both tobacco (Nicotiana benthamiana) and Arabidopsis resulted in reduced population growth of green peach aphid (Myzus persicae). Comparative RNA-Seq analyses of Arabidopsis lines expressing 35S:SbWRKY86-YFP identified changes in expression for a small network of genes associated with carbon-nitrogen metabolism and callose deposition, both contributing factors to defense against aphids. As a test of altered plant responses, 35S:SbWRKY86 Arabidopsis lines were activated using the flagellin epitope elicitor, flg22, and displayed significantly increased callose deposition. Our findings indicate that both heterologous and increased native expression of the transcription factor SbWRKY86 is associated with reduced aphid levels in diverse plant models. Less...

PRJNA783015	Bradyrhizobium japonicum IRAT FA3 alters Arabidopsis thaliana root architecture via regulation of auxin efflux transporters PIN2, PIN3, PIN7 and ABCB19	Beneficial rhizobacteria can stimulate changes in plant root development. While root system growth is mediated by multiple factors, the regulated distribution of the phytohormone auxin within root tissues plays a principal role. Auxin transport facilitators help to generate the auxin gradients and maxima that determine root structure. Here, we show that the plant growth promoting rhizobacterial strain Bradyrhizobium japonicum IRAT FA3 influences specific auxin efflux transporters to alter Arabidopsis thaliana root morphology. Co cultivation of the bacterium with loss of function auxin efflux transport mutants revealed that B. japonicum requires PIN3, PIN7 and ABCB19 to increase lateral root development and utilizes PIN2 to reduce primary root length. The absence of B. japonicum stimulated lateral root growth, in the form of accelerated lateral root primordia development through emergence, in single pin3, pin7 or abcb19 mutants suggested independent roles for PIN3, PIN7 and ABCB19 during the plant microbe interaction. Gene expression profiling of host transcripts in control and B. japonicum inoculated roots of the wild type A. thaliana accession Col 0 confirmed upregulation of PIN2, PIN3, PIN7 and ABCB19 with B. japonicum and identified genes potentially contributing to a diverse array of auxin related responses. Our work demonstrates B. japonicum's influence over host transcriptional reprogramming during plant interaction with this beneficial microbe and the subsequent alterations to root system architecture.

PRJNA769461	cAMP treatment mimics abiotic stress molecular response in Arabidopsis thaliana	The role of the RNA degradation product cyclic adenosine monophosphate is poorly understood. Recent studies have identified cAMP in plant material and determined its role in stress signaling. The level of cAMP increases upon wounding, dark, and heat, whereas cAMP binding to an RNA-binding protein, Rbp47b, promotes stress granule assembly. To gain further mechanistic insight into cAMP function, we used a multiOMIC approach combining transcriptomics, metabolomics, and proteomics to dissect Arabidopsis response to cAMP treatment. We demonstrated that cAMP is metabolized into adenosine, suggesting that a well-known cyclic nucleotide adenosine pathway from human cells might also exist in plants. Transcriptomic analysis of cAMP and adenosine-treated plants revealed only minor overlap, attesting that cAMP affects cellular processes independently of adenosine accumulation. Treatment with cAMP affected the levels of hundreds of transcripts, proteins, and metabolites, many previously associated with a plant stress response. For example, corroborating previous findings, proteins known as SG components were affected by cAMP. Finally, we demonstrated that cAMP treatment influences the movement of processing bodies, supporting the role of cAMP in the formation and motility of membraneless organelles. Less...

PRJNA780353	Genome-wide expression and variation in nucleotide sequences lead to differential response of Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes towards arsenic stress under sulphur limiting condition	Abiotic stresses such as heavy metals and nutrient imbalance constitute a significant threat to plant productivity. Among the known heavy metals, arsenic (As) toxicity has widely affected plants and animals. In the recent past, various approaches have been used to study and ameliorate As accumulation in the plants. Out of different approaches, the detoxification mechanism utilizes various sulphur related compounds; therefore, the limitation of sulphur leads to enhanced toxicity in plants. Though studies suggest links between As and sulphur responses, a deeper understanding about the molecular mechanisms of these responses is required. In this study, transcriptome analysis of the Arabidopsis accessions (Koz2-2 and Ri-0) with contrasting responses towards sulphate limitation and arsenic stress was carried out to identify genes involved in regulating various processes. Several genes associated with growth and development, stress or sulphate metabolism and secondary plant product biosynthesis were found to be differentially expressed in contrasting accessions under sulphate limitation and arsenic stress.

RHs actively expand the root surface responsible for nutrient uptake and water absorption. We have recently determined that RH growth was unexpectedly boosted when Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings are cultivated at low temperatures. It was proposed that RH growth plasticity in response to low temperature was linked to a reduced nutrient availability in the media. Here, we explored the molecular basis of this strong RH growth response by using the Genome Wide Association Studies (GWAS) approach on Arabidopsis thaliana natural accessions. We identified the poorly characterized PEROXIDASE 62 (PRX62) as a key protein triggering this conditional growth under a moderate low-temperature stress. In addition, we identified the related protein PRX69 as an important factor in this developmental process. The prx62 prx69 double mutant and the PRX62 and PRX69 over-expressing lines showed contrasting RH phenotypes, peroxidase activities and cytoplasmic (cyt)/ apoplastic (apo) Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) levels.Strikingly, a cell wall protein extensin (EXT) reporter revealed the effect of peroxidase activity on the EXT cell wall association at 10C in the RH apical zone. EXT cell wall insolubilization was enhanced at 10C, which was completely abolished under the PRX inhibitor salicylhydroxamic acid (SHAM) treatment and in the prx62 prx69 double mutant. Collectively, our results indicate that PRX62, and toa lower extent PRX69, are key apoplastic PRXs that modulate cyt-apoROS-homeostasis and cell wall EXT-insolubilization linked to RH elongation at low-temperature.Here we provide the RNA-seq data of Col, Bu, Wc, prx62, prx69, prx62prx69 Arabidopsis lines.

PRJNA761130	Arabidopsis thaliana cuticle composition contributes to differential defense response to Botrytis cinerea.	The chemical composition of the plant cuticle can change in response to various abiotic or biotic stresses and play essential functions in disease resistance responses. Arabidopsis thaliana mutants altered in cutin content are resistant to Botrytis cinerea, presumably due to increase cuticular water and solute permeability, allowing faster induction of defense responses. Within this context, our knowledge on wax mutants is limited against this pathogen. We tested the contribution of the cuticular components to immunity to B. cinerea by using mutants altered in either cutin or wax alone, or in both cutin and wax content. We found that even all tested mutants showed an increased permeability and ROS accumulation in comparison to wild-type plants, only cutin mutants showed resistance. To elucidate the early molecular mechanisms underlying cuticle-related immunity, we performed a transcriptomic analysis. A set of upregulated genes involved in the cell wall integrity and accumulation of ROS were shared by cutin mutants bdg, lacs2-3 and eca2, but not in wax mutants cer1-4 and cer3-6. Interestingly, these genes have recently been shown to be required to B. cinerea resistance. In contrast, we found the induction of genes involved in abiotic stress shared by the two wax mutants. Our study reveals new insights that the faster recognition of the pathogen by changes in the cuticular permeability is not enough to induce the resistance to B. cinerea as previously hypothesized. In addition, our data suggest that mutants with resistant phenotype can activate other defense pathways, different from those canonical immune ones. Less...

PRJNA793364	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana heat stress epitranscriptome	Plants are more susceptible to high temperature stress during reproductive development, which can cause drastic yield loss of fruit and seed crops. Unfortunately, the underlying mechanism remains largely unknown. Here we suggest that m6A RNA methylation level increases in the reproductive tissues of Arabidopsis and negatively regulates gene expression variability. It has been suggested that stochasticity of gene expression can be advantageous to fitness of living organisms under environmental challenges. Indeed, reduced gene expression variability in flowers was associated with compromised transcriptional activation of heat-responsive genes. Importantly, disruption of an RNA demethylase AtALKBH10B led to lower gene expression variability, hypo-responsiveness of heat-activated genes, and strong reduction of plant fertility. Overall, our work proposes a novel mechanism that m6A RNA modification mediates the bet-hedging strategy of plants challenged by heat stress. Less...

PRJNA757130	The zygotic division regulator ZAR1 plays a negative role in defense against Botrytis cinerea in Arabidopsis	A phosphorylation/dephosphorylation cycle at tyrosine 428 (Y428) of CHITIN ELICITOR RECEPTOR KINASE 1 (CERK1) plays an essential role in chitin-triggered immunity in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here, we used a differential peptide pull-down (PPD) assay to identify factors that could participate downstream of this cycle. We identified ZYGOTIC ARREST 1 (ZAR1) and showed that it interacts with CERK1 specifically when the Y428 residue of CERK1 is dephosphorylated. ZAR1 was originally characterized as a membrane integrator for calmodulin and G-protein signals to regulate zygotic division in Arabidopsis. Our current results establish that ZAR1 also negatively contributes to defense against the fungus Botrytis cinerea and plays a redundant role with its homolog ZAR2 in this process. The zar1-3 zar2-1 double mutant exhibited stronger resistance to B. cinerea compared to zar1-3 single mutant, zar2-1 single mutant, and wild-type plants. Moreover, the inducible expression of numerous defense response genes upon B. cinerea infection was increased in the zar1-3 zar2 double mutant, consistent with a repressive role for ZAR proteins in the defense response. Our findings thus provide insight into the function of ZAR1 in multiple defense and developmental regulation pathways. Less...

Here, we found an epigenetic signature of selection in experimental Arabidopsis thaliana populations of epigenetic variants called epiRILs harbouring almost identical DNA sequences but differential methylation regions.

PRJEB47201	RNA-seq GLV6 overexpression during lateral root initiation in Arabidopsis thaliana	The goal of this experiment was to identify the downstream targets of the GOLVEN6 peptide signaling pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana, specifically during lateral root initiation. Using an estradiol inducible GLV6 overexpression construct in wildtype and rgi1rgi5 double mutant (mutant in receptors for the GLV6 peptide) backgrounds, in combination with gravistimulation induced lateral root formation, the RGI receptor dependent transcriptional effects of GLV6 overexpression were characterized. An estradiol inducible GLV6 overexpression line in a wildtype (iGLV6) and in an rgi1rgi5 double receptor mutant background (rgi1rgi5/iGLV6) were used. 4-day old seedlings of both lines were gravistimulated (vertically grown seedlings were turned counterclockwise by 90°) to induce lateral root initiation in the resulting root bends. 8h after gravistimulation, seedlings of both lines were treated with 2µM of estradiol to induce GLV6 overexpression, or DMSO as a mock treatment. 3h and 6h after treatment, root bends were dissected and collected for RNA-sequencing. This yielded a total of 8 samples per replicate; 3h mock treated iGLV6 (IM3), 3h estradiol treated iGLV6 (IE3), 3h mock treated rgi1rgi5/iGLV6 (RM3), 3h estradiol treated rgi1rgi5/iGLV6 (RE3), 6h mock treated iGLV6 (IM6), 6h estradiol treated iGLV6 (IE6), 6h mock treated rgi1rgi5/iGLV6 (RM6), 6h estradiol treated rgi1rgi5/iGLV6 (RE6). For each sample, 4 replicates were obtained. This setup enabled the comparison of the GLV6 induced transcriptional effects between wildtype and rgi1rgi5 mutants at 2 time points after treatment, in samples that are strongly enriched for lateral root initiation events.

PRJNA753100	Genome-wide identification of transcribed enhancer candidates during pattern triggered immunity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Proper transcriptional reprogramming is central for hosts to launch an effective defense response upon pathogen attack. Relatively short DNA sequences known as enhancers play a key role in gene regulation by increasing the amount of transcription from associated genes. Here, we investigate the Arabidopsis thaliana distal enhancers involved in early innate immunity. Using an integrated computational pipeline, a class of low abundant transcripts that are transcribed uni- or bidirectionally from putative distal enhancers are identified based on intergenic open chromatin. Most of them may be non-polyadenylated, which are in concert with the enhancer RNAs (eRNAs) found in mammalian cells. The production of eRNAs at distal enhancers is strongly correlated with open chromatin architecture, low DNA methylation, as well as the enrichment of RNA poly II and acetylated histone marks. Immune transcription factors are enriched in the PTI-induced enhancers, such as WRKYs and SARD1, and up-regulated enhancers significantly associated with early immune gene regulation. Moreover, a subset of core patterns induced-enhancers was defined which up-regulated by multiple patterns from diverse pathogens.

PRJNA758370	The tetratricopeptide repeat and J-domain containing proteins DJC31 and DJC62 are involved in abiotic stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Molecular chaperones play an important role during the response to different stresses. Since plants are sessile organisms, they need to be able to adapt quickly to different conditions. To do so, plants possess a complex chaperone machinery, composed of HSP70, HSP90, J-proteins and other factors. In this study we characterized DJC31 and DJC62, two J-proteins that additionally carry clamp type tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domains. Using cell fractionation and self-assembly GFP, we could show that both proteins are attached to the cytosolic side of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane. Moreover, an interaction with cytosolic HSP70 and HSP90 could be shown by bimolecular fluorescence complementation. Knockout of either DJC31 or DJC62 caused only a mild phenotype, which is overall comparable to wild type. However, the double mutant exhibited severe defects in growth and development, which affected almost all organs. Furthermore, it could be shown that the double mutant is more sensitive to osmotic stress and treatment with abscisic acid, but surprisingly exhibited enhanced tolerance to drought. Taken together, these findings indicate that DJC31 and DJC62 might be acting as important regulators of chaperone dependent signalling pathways involved in plant development and stress response.

It has been reported that SPL family members, such as SPL3, regulate Pi deficiency responses by controlling the expression of Pi deficiency responsive genes. To elucidate whether SPL9 respond to low phosphorus stress, we investigated the phenotypes and conduct RNA sequencing analysis in transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana with overexpressing SPL9 (R9) under conditions of both normal and low Pi availability. Compared with wild-type plants, R9 showed decreased anthocyanin accumulation and increased Pi contents in shoots under Pi deficiency. Through RNA-seq analysis compared with wild-type plants, we detected 217 genes significantly differentially expressed in conditions of Pi sufficiency, and 121 genes differentially expressed in conditions of Pi deficiency in R9 plants. Under Pi deficiency, these genes included multiple protein kinases, jasmonic acid response genes and genes related to salt stress responses. Genes associated with hydrolase and transferase activity were also differentially regulated by Pi deficiency, such as cytochrome P450 monooxygenases. Of particular note, the transcription factor AP2-EREBP and members of the bHLH family were among the most significantly differentially regulated genes identified under both Pi sufficient and Pi deficient conditions.

PRJNA760915	A missense mutation in COP1 SUPPRESSOR 5 causes reversed action in mediating photomorphogenic development (thale cress)	"CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) mediates various cellular and physiological processes in plants by targeting a large number of substrates for ubiquitination and degradation. In this study, we reveal that a substitution of Pro for Leu at the site of 409 in COP1 SUPPRESSOR 5 (CSU5, also called WRKY32) largely suppresses the short hypocotyls and expanded cotyledon phenotypes of cop1-6. CSU5P409L promotes the hypocotyl growth and inhibits the opening of cotyledons in plants. Loss of CSU5 function mutant seedlings display elongated hypocotyls, whereas overexpression of CSU5 leads to shortened hypocotyls. CSU5 directly associates with the promoter regions of HY5 to activate its transcription. Although COP1 interacts with both CSU5 and CSU5P409L, it negatively controls the stability of CSU5, but not CSU5P409L. CSU5P409L exhibits enhanced DNA binding ability and affects the expression of more genes compared with CSU5. Our results not only reveal the molecular role for CSU5 in promoting photomorphogenesis, but also provide insights into manipulating plant growth by engineering key components of light signaling.

The biological functions of tsRNAs in plants remain largely unknown. In this study, we developed RtcB-based RNA sequencing, a method that captures and distinguishes between 2’,3’-cyclic-phosphate (cP)-terminated RNAs and 3’-OH-terminated RNAs, and profiled 5’ tsRNAs and 5’ tRNA halves in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that Arabidopsis 5’ tsRNAs and 5’ tRNA halves predominantly contain a cP at the 3’ end and require S-like RNase 1 (RNS1) and RNS3 for their production. One of the most abundant 5’ tsRNA, 5’ tsR-Ala, likely by associating with AGO1, negatively regulates Cytochrome P450 71A13 (CYP71A13) expression and camalexin biosynthesis to repress anti-fungal defense. 5’ tsR-Ala is downregulated upon fungal infection. Our study provides a global view of 5’ tsRNAs and 5’ tRNA halves in Arabidopsis and unravels an important role of a 5’ tsRNA in regulating anti-fungal defense.

Both animal and plant miRNAs are essential for the spatio-temporal regulation of development but together with this role, plant miRNAs, also control transposable elements and stimulate the production of epigenetically-active small interfering RNAs. This last role is evident in the plant male gamete containing structure, the male gametophyte or pollen grain but how the dual role of plant miRNAs is integrated during its development is unknown. Here, we provide a detailed analysis of miRNA dynamics during pollen development and their genic and transposable element targets using small RNA and PARE high-throughput sequencing. Furthermore we uncover the miRNAs loaded in the two main AGOs in the mature pollen grain, AGO1 and AGO5.

PRJNA762005	Epigenetic inheritance mediates phenotypic evolution in natural populations (thale cress)	"Genetic variation is regarded as a prerequisite for evolution. Theoretical models suggest epigenetic information inherited independently of DNA sequence can also enable evolution. However, whether epigenetic inheritance mediates phenotypic evolution in natural populations is unknown. Here we show that natural epigenetic DNA methylation variation in gene bodies regulates genes expression, and thereby influences the natural variation of complex traits in Arabidopsis thaliana. Notably, the effects of methylation variation on phenotypic diversity and gene expression variance are comparable with those of DNA sequence polymorphism. We also identify methylation epialleles in numerous genes associated with environmental conditions in native habitats, suggesting that intragenic methylation facilitates adaptation to fluctuating environments. Our results demonstrate that methylation variation fundamentally shapes phenotypic diversity in natural populations and provides an epigenetic basis for adaptive Darwinian evolution independent of genetic polymorphism.

PRJNA762245	Arabidopsis Apoplastic Fluids Contain sRNA- and Circular RNA-Protein Complexes That Are Located Outside of Extracellular Vesicles (thale cress)	"The extracellular space within plant leaves is called the apoplast, and functions as a key battlefield between plants and pathogens. Previously, we have shown that apoplastic wash fluid purified from Arabidopsis leaves contains small RNAs (sRNAs). To investigate whether these RNAs are encapsulated inside extracellular vesicles (EVs), we treated EVs isolated from Arabidopsis leaves with the protease trypsin and RNase A, which should degrade RNAs located outside of EVs, but not those located inside. These analyses revealed that apoplastic RNAs are mostly located outside of EVs and are associated with proteins. Additional analyses of these extracellular RNAs (exRNAs) revealed that they are made up both sRNAs and long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), including circular RNAs (circRNAs). We also found that exRNAs are highly enriched in the post-transcriptional modification N6-methyladenine (m6A). Consistent with this, we identified a putative m6A-binding protein in apoplastic wash fluids, GLYCINE-RICH RNA BINDING PROTEIN 7 (GRP7), as wells as the small RNA-binding protein ARGONAUTE2 (AGO2).  These two proteins co-immunoprecipitated with each other, and with lncRNAs, including circRNAs. Mutation of GRP7 or AGO2 caused changes in both the sRNA and lncRNA content of apoplastic wash fluid, suggesting that these proteins contribute to the secretion and/or stabilization of exRNAs.

This is the first time to generate mddcc that allow us to elucidate the roles of DNA methylation in the upheaval of histone modification landscape, transposon activity and gene expression. We found that DNA methylation elimination-triggered genome-wide transcriptional reprogramming is largely orchestrated by the redistribution and conversion of histone modifications. We also distinguished the contribution of CG and non-CG methylation to the histone modification landscape. Furthermore, we reveal histone modifications can serve as an independent regulatory system despite the influence of DNA methylation.

Some plant species have adopted a bet-hedging strategy to germinate a variable fraction of seeds in any given condition, and this could be explained by population-based threshold models. Here, in the model plant Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) we induced secondary dormancy to address the transcriptional heterogeneity among seeds that leads to binary germination/non-germination outcomes. We developed a single seed RNA-seq strategy that allowed us to observe a reduction in seed transcriptional heterogeneity as seeds enter stress conditions, followed by an increase during recovery. We identified groups of genes whose expression showed a specific pattern through a time course and used these groups to position the individual seeds along the transcriptional gradient of germination competence. In agreement, transcriptomes of dormancy-deficient seeds (mutant of DELAY OF GERMINATION 1 gene) showed a shift towards higher values of the germination competence index. Interestingly, a significant fraction of genes with variable expression encoded translation-related factors. In summary, interrogating hundreds of single seed transcriptomes during secondary dormancy-inducing treatment revealed variability among the transcriptomes that could result from the distribution of population-based sensitivity thresholds. Our results also showed that single seed RNA-seq is the method of choice for analyzing seed bet-hedging-related phenomena.
Overall design: 1) Three libraries, each consisting of 32 seeds were prepared for each time point of secondary dormancy induction time course for Arabidopsis seeds (1h, 1d, 3d, 5d, 7d, 7d+24h, pool-split control). 2) Three libraries, each consisting of 32 seeds were prepared for two time points of secondary dormancy induction (3d, 7d+24h) and two genotypes (Col-0 and dog1-4 mutant). 3) Comparison of dry seed transcriptome of Col-0 and dog1-4 mutant (three biological replicas).

PRJNA641025	NuA4 and H2A.Z control environmental responses and autotrophic growth in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The nucleosomal acetyltransferase of H4 (NuA4) is an essential transcriptional coactivator in eukaryotes, though it remains poorly characterized in plants. Here, we describe Arabidopsis homologues of the NuA4 scaffold proteins Enhancer of Polycomb-Like1 (EPL1) and Esa1-Associated Factor1 (EAF1). Loss of AtEAF1 results in inhibition of growth and chloroplast development. These effects are stronger in the Atepl1 mutant and are further enhanced by loss of Golden2-Like (GLK) transcription factors suggesting that NuA4 activates nuclear plastidic genes alongside GLK. We demonstrate that AtEPL1 is necessary for nucleosomal acetylation of histones H4 and H2A.Z by NuA4 in vitro. These chromatin marks are diminished in Atepl1 genome-wide while another active chromatin mark H3K9ac is locally enhanced. Many chloroplast-related genes depend on NuA4 as they are downregulated with loss of H4ac and H2A.Z alone. Finally, we demonstrate that NuA4 promotes deposition of H2A.Z and by doing so prevents spurious activation of stress response genes.
Overall design: RNA-Seq transcriptome analysis of of A. thaliana wild type, Atepl1-2,  Ateaf1-1, glk leaves, and ChIP-Seq profiling of wild type and Atepl1-2 for H3K9ac, H4K5ac, H2A.Zac and H2A.Z Less..."

PRJNA767675	Altered H3K27 trimethylation contributes to flowering time variations in polyploid Arabidopsis thaliana ecotypes (thale cress)	"Polyploidy is a widespread phenomenon in flowering plant species. Polyploid plants frequently exhibit considerable transcriptomic alterations after whole-genome duplication (WGD). It is known that the transcriptomic response to tetraploidization is ecotype-dependent in Arabidopsis. Nevertheless, the biological significance and the underlying mechanism are unknown. Here, we showed that 4x Col-0 and 4x Ler presented different flowering times, with a delayed flowering time in 4x Col-0 but not in 4x Ler. We found that the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), the major repressor of flowering, was significantly increased in 4x Col-0 but subtle change in 4x Ler. Moreover, the level of a repressive epigenetic mark, trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 27 (H3K27me3), was significantly decreased in 4x Col-0 but not in 4x Ler, potentially leading to different transcription levels of FLC and flowering time in 4x Col-0 and 4x Ler. Apart from the FLC locus, hundreds of genes showed differentially H3K27me3 alterations in 4x Col-0 and 4x Ler. Comparably, LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) and transcription factors required for H3K27me3 deposition presented differential transcriptional changes between 4x Col and Ler, potentially account for differential H3K27me3 alterations in 4x Col-0 and Ler. Last, we found that the natural 4x Arabidopsis ecotype Wa-1 presented early flowering time, associated with low expression and high H3K27me3 of FLC. Taken together, our results showed a role of H3K27me3 alterations in response to genome duplication in Arabidopsis autopolyploids and that flowering time variation potentially functions in autopolyploid speciation.

Heat treatment causes transcriptional readthrough events in hot1-4 shot2, specifically in highly heat-induced genes, including the toxic hot1-4 gene. In addition, failure of correct transcript processing leads to reduced accumulation of many HSP RNAs and proteins, suppressing heat sensitivity of the hot1-4 mutant, due to reduction of the toxic mutant HSP101 protein.

PRJNA716808	DNA methylation-free Arabidopsis reveals crucial roles of DNA methylation in regulating gene expression and plant development (thale cress)	"A contribution of DNA methylation to defense against invading nucleic acids and maintenance of genome integrity is uncontested; however, the relevance of this epigenetic mark for genome-wide gene regulation and plant development is unclear. Here, we knocked out all five known DNA methyltransferases in Arabidopsis, generating DNA methylation-free plants. This quintuple mutant exhibits a suite of unique and extreme developmental defects, unequivocally demonstrating that DNA methylation is essential for normal plant development. We show that CG methylation or non-CG methylation alone or jointly control multiple biological processes, including pavement cell shape, endoreduplication, cell death, flowering, trichome morphology, vasculature and meristem development, and root cell fate determination. Moreover, we found that DNA methylation has a strong dose-dependent effect in the regulation of gene expression and the repression of transposable element movement. Thus, our results demonstrate crucial roles of DNA methylation in orchestrating plant development and provide new insights into the function of this epigenetic mark in regulating gene expression in higher eukaryotes.

PRJNA778396	FERONIA regulates plant growth and survival under salt stress by modulating the dark reversion of phyB via a signature of phosphorylation (thale cress)	"Here we report that FERONIA (FER) integrates phyB-mediated light signaling pathway to control salt stress response. Mutation in phytochrome B (phyB) largely suppresses the dwarfism and leaf bleaching phenotype of fer-4 mutant under salt stress. FER interacts with and phosphorylates the N-terminal domain of phyB. Mutation in fer-4 or disruption of the FER-mediated phosphorylation sites of phyB at Ser106 and Ser227 leads to a retention of phyB in the photobodies under dark conditions, suggesting that FER-mediated phosphorylation accelerates the dark reversion of phyB. Interestingly, salt stress slows down the dark reversion of phyB via the inhibition of the kinase activity of FER, and mutation of phyB or overexpression of PIF5 attenuates the salt-induced growth inhibition. Together, our study indicates that the plasma membrane-localized FER determines the dark reversion rate of phyB in the nucleus via a signature of phosphorylation and thus coordinates the extracellular stress signals and nuclear outputs to dynamically control plant growth and survival under stress conditions.

PRJNA779072	Histone chaperone ASF1 mediates H3.3-H4 deposition in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Histone chaperones and chromatin remodelers control nucleosome dynamics, which are essential for transcription, replication, and DNA repair. The histone chaperone Anti-Silencing Factor 1 (ASF1) plays a central role in facilitating CAF-1-mediated replication-dependent H3.1 deposition and HIRA-mediated replication-independent H3.3 deposition in yeast and metazoans. Whether ASF1 function is evolutionarily conserved in plants is unknown. Here, we show that Arabidopsis ASF1 proteins display a preference for the HIRA complex. Simultaneous mutation of both Arabidopsis ASF1 genes caused a decrease in chromatin density and ectopic H3.1 occupancy at loci typically enriched with H3.3. Genetic, transcriptomic, and proteomic data indicate that ASF1 proteins strongly prefers the HIRA complex over CAF-1. asf1 mutants also displayed an increase in spurious Pol II transcriptional initiation and showed defects in the maintenance of gene body CG DNA methylation and in the distribution of histone modifications. Furthermore, ectopic targeting of ASF1 caused excessive histone deposition, less accessible chromatin, and gene silencing. These findings reveal the importance of ASF1-mediated histone deposition for proper epigenetic regulation of the genome.

Here, we show that Phytophthora suppressor of RNA silencing 1 (PSR1) contributes to the pathogenicity of Phytophthora sojae and specifically binds to three conserved C-terminal domains of the eukaryotic PSR1-Interacting Protein 1 (PINP1). PINP1 encodes a core pre-mRNA splicing factor PRP16, which unwinds RNA duplexes and binds to pri-miRNAs and general RNAs. Intriguingly, PSR1 decreased both RNA helicase and RNA-binding activity of PINP1, thereby dampening sRNA biogenesis and RNA metabolism. The PSR1-PINP1 interaction caused global changes in alternative splicing (AS). A total of 5,135 genes simultaneously exhibited mis-splicing in both PSR1-overexpressing and PINP1-silenced plants. AS upregulated many mRNA transcripts with their introns retained. The high occurrence of intron-retention (IR) in AS-induced transcripts significantly promoted Phytophthora pathogen infection in Nicotiana benthamiana, which might be caused by the production of truncated proteins. Taken together, our findings uncover a novel role for PINP1 in regulating sRNA biogenesis and plant immunity.

HAKAI is required for the interaction between HIZ1 and MTA. Whilst HIZ1 knockout plants have normal levels of m6A, plants in which it is overexpressed show reduced methylation. In addition, HIZ1 was found to be involved in root hair development upon auxin transport inhibition in a HAKAI-dependent manner. Mutant plants lacking HIZ2 are viable but have an 85% reduction in m6A abundance and show severe developmental defects. Our findings suggest that HIZ1 appears to be a HAKAI-dependent negative regulator of m6A deposition and HIZ2 is a novel and essential member of the Arabidopsis m6A writer complex.

PRJNA780007	Phytochrome B regulates reactive oxygen signaling during stress in plants. (thale cress)	"Plants are essential for life on Earth converting light into chemical energy in the form of sugars. To adjust for changes in light intensity and quality, and to become as efficient as possible in harnessing light, plants evolved multiple light receptors, signaling, and acclimation mechanisms. In addition to altering plant metabolism, development and growth, light cues sensed by some photoreceptors, such as phytochromes, are also impacting many plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses. Central for plant responses to different stresses are reactive oxygen species (ROS) that function as key signaling molecules. Recent studies demonstrated that respiratory burst oxidase homolog (RBOH) proteins that reside at the plasma membrane and produce ROS at the apoplast play a key role in plant responses to different biotic and abiotic stresses. Here we reveal that phytochrome B (phyB) and RBOHs function as part of a key regulatory module that controls ROS production, transcript expression, and plant acclimation to excess light stress. We further show that phyB can regulate ROS production during stress even if it is restricted to the cytosol, and that phyB, RBOHD and RBOHF co-regulate thousands of transcripts in response to light stress. Surprisingly, we found that phyB is also required for ROS accumulation in response to heat, wounding, cold, and bacterial infection. Taken together, our findings reveal that phyB plays a canonical role in plant responses to biotic and abiotic stresses, regulating ROS production, and that phyB and RBOHs function in the same regulatory pathway.

The role of BTS in root tissues has been well established. However, its role in shoot tissues has been scarcely studied. Comparative transcriptome analysis with shoot and root tissues revealed that BTS is involved in regulating energy metabolism by modulating expression of mitochondrial and chloroplast genes in shoot tissues. Moreover, in shoot tissues of bts-1 plants, levels of ADP and ATP and the ratio of ADP/ATP were greatly increased with a concomitant decrease in levels of soluble sugar and starch. The decreased starch level inbts-1 shoot tissues was restored to the level of shoot tissues of wild-type plants upon vanadate treatment. Through this study, we expand the role of BTS to regulation of energy metabolism in the shoot in addition to its role of iron deficiency response in roots.

PRJNA782305	SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME B4#3 reduces the expression of PIF-activated genes and increases expression of growth repressors to regulate hypocotyl elongation in short days [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME B4-#3 (SOB3) is a member of the AT-HOOK MOTIF CONTAINING NUCLEAR LOCALIZED (AHL) family of transcription factors that are involved in light-mediated growth in Arabidopsis thaliana, affecting processes such as hypocotyl elongation. The majority of the research on the AHLs has been conducted in continuous light. However, there are unique molecular events that promote growth in short days (SD) compared to constant light conditions. Therefore, we investigated how AHLs affect hypocotyl elongation in SD. Firstly, we observed that SOB3 inhibits hypocotyl growth in SD, similar to its effects in constant light. Next, we identified AHL-regulated genes in SD-grown seedlings by performing RNA-Seq in two sob3 mutants at different time points. Our transcriptomic data indicate that PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs) 4, 5, 7, and 8 along with PIF-target genes are repressed by AHLs. We also identified PIF target genes that are repressed and have not been previously described as AHL-regulated, including PRE1, PIL1, HFR1, CDF5, and XTR7. Interestingly, our RNA-seq data also suggest that AHLs activate the expression of growth repressors to control hypocotyl elongation, such as HY5 and IAA17. Notably, many growth-regulating and other genes affected by SOB3 were differentially regulated between these two sob3 mutants at the time points tested. Surprisingly, our ChIP-seq data indicate that SOB3 mostly binds to similar genes throughout the day. Collectively, these data indicate that SOB3 affects gene expression in a time point-specific manner irrespective of changes in binding throughout SD.

We developed Bookend, a software package for transcript assembly that incorporates data from different RNA-seq techniques, with a focus on identifying and utilizing RNA 5′ and 3′ ends. Through end-guided assembly with Bookend we demonstrate that correct modeling of transcript start and end sites is essential for precise transcript assembly. Furthermore, we discovered that utilization of end-labeled reads present in full-length single-cell RNA-seq (scRNA-seq) datasets dramatically improves the precision of transcript assembly in single cells. Finally, we show that hybrid assembly across short-read, long-read, and end-capture RNA-seq datasets from Arabidopsis, as well as meta-assembly of RNA-seq from single mouse embryonic stem cells (mESCs) can produce end-to-end transcript annotations of comparable quality to reference annotations in these model organisms.

PRJNA785867	Transcriptomic profiling of Arabidopsis hypocotyls of brl3 mutants and tissue-specific overexpressors under elevated temperatures (thale cress)	"Climate change is having a drastic impact on global agriculture. Indeed stress factors such as elevated temperature, drought and rising atmospheric CO2 reduce arable land surface, crop cultivation and yield and overall sustainable food production on earth. However, plants possess immense innate adaptive plasticity and a more in-depth understanding of the underlying molecular mechanisms is crucial to strategize for sustaining populations under worsening climate change. Brassinosteroids (BRs) are constitutive plant growth regulators that also control plant adaptation to abiotic stress. Downstream components of the BR biosynthetic pathway, BES1/BZR1 play central role in thermomorphogenesis, but involvement of the BR receptors is not well understood. Here, we show that the BRL3 receptor is essential for plant adaptation to warmer environment. The brl3 mutants lack thermal responsiveness and the BRL3 overexpression causes hyper-thermomorphogenesis response. BRL3 activates canonical BRI1 pathway upon elevated temperature. Further, phloem-specific expression of BRL3 completely rescues the growth adaptation defects of the brl3 mutant. This ability of BRL3 represents a previously unknown thermoresponsive mechanism specifically from phloem and uncouples the roles of BR receptors in generic growth vs adaptation to changing climate conditions.

PRJNA786631	Systematic histone H4 replacement in Arabidopsis thaliana reveals a role for H4R17 in regulating flowering time (thale cress)	"Despite the broad array of roles for epigenetic mechanisms on regulating diverse processes in eukaryotes, no experimental system for the direct assessment of histone function is currently available in plants. In this work, we present the development of a genetic strategy in Arabidopsis thaliana in which modified H4 transgenes can completely replace the expression of endogenous histone H4. Using this strategy, we established a collection of plants expressing different H4 point mutants targeting residues that may be post-translationally modified in vivo. To demonstrate the utility of this new H4 mutant collection, we screened it to uncover substitutions in H4 that alter flowering time. We identified different mutations in the tail (H4R17A) and the globular domain (H4R36A, H4R39K, H4R39A, and H4K44A) of H4 that strongly accelerate the floral transition. Furthermore, we found a conserved regulatory relationship between H4R17 and the ISWI chromatin remodeling complex in plants. Similar to other biological systems, H4R17 regulates nucleosome spacing via ISWI.

PRJNA787244	A Fungal Effector Suppresses the Nuclear Export of AGO1-miRNA Complex to Promote Infection in Plants (thale cress)	"Communication between interacting organisms via bioactive molecules is widespread  in nature and plays key roles in diverse biological processes. Small RNAs (sRNAs) can  travel between host plants and filamentous pathogens to trigger trans-kingdom RNA  interference (RNAi) in recipient cells and modulate plant defense and pathogen  virulence. However, how trans-kingdom RNAi is regulated has rarely been reported. Here, we show that the secretory protein VdSSR1 (secretory silencing repressor 1) from Verticillium dahliae, a soil-borne phytopathogenic fungus that causes wilt diseases in a  wide range of plant hosts, is required for fungal virulence in plants through the  suppression of trans-kingdom RNAi.

PRJNA790961	Transcriptomic profile of FERONIA mutant treated with Aradopside (thale cress)	"FERONIA (FER) receptor kinase has a versatile role in plant growth and development, biotic and abiotic stress responses, and reproduction. To gain new insights into the molecular interplay of these processes and to identify new functions of FER, we carried out quantitative transcriptome, proteome, and phosphoproteome profiling of wild type (WT) and a loss-of-function fer mutant in Arabidopsis plants. Gene Ontology terms for hormone signaling, abiotic stress, and biotic stress were significantly enriched among mis-expressed transcripts, proteins, and/or mis-phosphorylated proteins, in agreement with FER’s known roles in these processes. Analysis of multi-omics data and subsequent experimental evidence identified previously unknown functions of FER in ER (Endoplasmic Reticulum) body formation, glucosinolate biosynthesis. FER functions through transcription factor NAI1 to mediate ER body. FER also negatively regulates indole glucosinolates biosynthesis, partially through NAI1. Furthermore, we found that a group of abscisic acid (ABA)-induced transcription factors are hypo-phosphorylated in the fer mutant and demonstrated that FER acts through ABI5 to negatively regulate the ABA response during germination. Our integrated-omics study therefore reveals novel functions of FER and provides new insights into the underlying mechanisms of FER function.

PRJNA790958	Somatic DNA demethylation generates tissue-specific methylation states and impacts flowering time [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Cytosine methylation is a reversible epigenetic modification to DNA. In plants, removal of cytosine methylation is accomplished by the four members of the DME family of 5-methylcytosine DNA glycosylases. Demethylation by DME is critical for seed development. Consequently, determining the function of the entire gene family in somatic tissues by mutant analysis has not been possible. Here, we bypassed the reproductive defects of dme mutants to create somatic quadruple homozygous mutants of the entire DME family. dme; ros1; dml2; dml3 (drdd) leaves exhibit hypermethylated genomes compared to both wild-type plants and rdd triple mutants, indicating functional redundancy among all four demethylases. Targets of demethylation include regions co-targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation and, surprisingly, CG gene body methylation, indicating dynamic methylation at these less-understood sites. Additionally, many tissue-specific methylation differences are absent in drdd, suggesting a role for active demethylation in generating divergent epigenetic states across wild-type tissues. Furthermore, drdd plants display an early flowering phenotype, which is correlated with 5’ hypermethylation and transcriptional down-regulation of FLOWERING LOCUS C. Active DNA demethylation is therefore required for proper methylation patterning across somatic tissues and defines the epigenetic landscape of both intergenic and coding regions.

PRJNA791323	Azospirillum brasilense alters root system architecture through both auxin-dependent and -independent pathways (thale cress)	"Azospirillum is a plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) with ability to produce several phytohormones such as auxins, mainly indole-3-acetic acid (IAA).  The positive interaction of Azospirillum with plants has been simplified and explained through the bacterial capacity to produce IAA. Typical changes on root architecture by promoting the number of lateral roots and hair formation, and reducing the primary root length were established in inoculated plants. These changes increase the root surface improving the water and nutrients acquisition, and thus the growth of the whole plant. The mechanisms by which Azospirillum induces such changes fails to be explained only by the bacterial capacity to produce IAA. In this work, we have evaluated the root architecture and gene expression changes occurred in Arabidopsis thaliana inoculated with A. brasilense Az39 and the IAA-deficient mutant (Az39 ipdC-), or treated with exogenous IAA solution to confirm both, the IAA-dependent and IAA-independent Azospirillum´s pathways to promote the root growth. Our results demonstrate the ability of Az39 to modify the primary root development through IAA biosynthesis, while other IAA-independent mechanisms were related to an increase in the lateral roots development and the root hairs number. Jasmonates, ethylene and salicylic acid were increased in the IAA-deficient bacterial treatments, as the ipdC mutant significantly up-regulated transcription of genes enriched of these phytohormones signaling after 7 days. Further, the physical presence of the inactive bacteria (Az39φ) seems to mediate the development of root hairs, a mechanism common to other non-PGPR as E. coli DH5α. Our results suggest that Az39 inoculation induces morphological changes in root architecture through both IAA-dependent and independent mechanism. The IAA biosynthesis by Az39 reduces the primary root length; while the cells contact with the roots increases the root hairs production. Both the synthesis of active IAA and the presence of metabolically active Az39 cells increase the growth and development of lateral roots.  
Overall design: 2 strains of Azospirillum rhizobacteria (Az39 and -ipdc mutant) and an NaCl control were applied to the roots of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings for transcriptomic analysis at 24 hours and 7 days post treatment; 2 replicates each, of at least 50 root systems per rep Less..."

PRJNA792010	Genome-wide binding patterns of the Plastid-encoded polymerase in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Plastids are endosymbiotic organelles containing their own genomes, which are transcribed by two types of RNA polymerases. One of those enzymes is a bacterial-type, multi-subunit polymerase encoded by the plastid genome. The plastid-encoded polymerase (PEP) is required for efficient expression of genes encoding proteins involved in photosynthesis. Despite the importance of PEP, its DNA binding locations have not been studied on the genome-wide scale at high resolution. We established a highly specific approach to detect the genome-wide pattern of PEP binding to chloroplasts DNA using ptChIP-seq. We found that in mature Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts, PEP has a complex pattern of binding to DNA with preferential association at genes encoding rRNA, tRNA and a subset of photosynthetic proteins. Sigma factors SIG2 and SIG6 strongly impact PEP binding to a subset of tRNA genes and have more moderate effects on PEP binding throughout the rest of the genome. PEP binding is commonly enriched on gene promoters, around transcription start sites. Finally, the levels of PEP binding to DNA are correlated with the levels of RNA accumulation, which allowed estimating the quantitative contribution of transcription to RNA accumulation.
Overall design: The data consists of 2 or 3 replicates of ptChIP from pTAC12-HA or RpoB protein in Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 wild type, sig2-2 or sig6-1 genotypes from 4 or 14 days-old plants.

PRJNA795495	Components of the autonomous flowering pathway form a complex that suppresses FLC transcription by regulating multiple histone modifications [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The autonomous flowering pathway promotes flowering in rapid-flowering accessions of Arabidopsis thaliana by reducing the expression of the key flowering repressor gene FLC. Although previous studies identified several autonomous pathway components, little is known about how these components cooperate in the regulation of flowering time. Here, we identified an autonomous pathway complex (APC) composed of three known autonomous pathway components (FLD, LD, and SDG26) and three previously uncharacterized components (EFL2, EFL4, and APRF1). Loss-of-function mutations of all of these components result in increased FLC expression and delayed flowering. The late-flowering phenotype is independent of photoperiod and can be overcome by vernalization, supporting the inference that the complex regulates flowering time specifically through the autonomous pathway. Our ChIP-seq analyses indicated that the APC components are required for the suppression of the histone modifications (H3Ac, H3K4me3, and H3K36me3) associated with the activation of gene expression and for the promotion of the histone modification (H3K27me3) associated with the repression of gene expression at FLC. We also found that the C-terminal coiled-coil domain of SDG26 binds to DNA in vitro and that the DNA-binding ability mediates the association of SDG26 with FLC chromatin in vivo. These results reveal the molecular basis of the autonomous pathway.

Method： The mRNA profiles of 10-day-old wild-type (WT) and AHL13 knockout (ahl13, SALK_014014) Arabidopsis were generated by RNAseq using Illumina NovaSeq6000. The sequence reads were passed through quality filters and mapped to Arabidopsis genome by TopHat2 followed by transcript splicing and quantitation by Cufflinks. DESeq was done to analyze differential gene expressions. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays
Result: We mapped about 20 million sequencing reads per sample to the Arabidopsis genome and identified approximately 28,000 transcripts in the Arabidopsis Col-0 and ahl13 mutant using TopHat2. Differentially expressed genes were identified using DESeq2 and about 166 genes show up-regulation in ahl13 upon DC3000 infection (FC>2, FDR<0.01)

PRJNA753821	Local and global crosstalk among heterochromatin marks drives epigenome patterning in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Transposable elements (TEs) are robustly silenced by multiple epigenetic marks, but dynamics of crosstalk among these marks remains enigmatic. In Arabidopsis, TEs are silenced by cytosine methylation in both CpG and non-CpG contexts (mCG and mCH) and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me). While mCH and H3K9me are mutually dependent for their maintenance, mCG and mCH/H3K9me are independently maintained. Here we show that establishment, rather than maintenance, of mCH depends on mCG, accounting for the synergistic colocalization of these silent marks in TEs. When mCG is lost, establishment of mCH is abolished in TEs. mCG also guides mCH in active genes, although  the resulting mCH/H3K9me is removed thereafter. Unexpectedly, targeting efficiency of mCH depends on relative, rather than absolute, levels of mCG within the genome, suggesting underlying global negative controls. We propose that local positive feedback in heterochromatin dynamics, together with global negative feedback, drive robust and balanced DNA methylome patterning.

PRJNA798004	The Arabidopsis NuA4 histone acetyltransferase complex is required for chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis. [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Although two Enhancer of Polycomb-like proteins, EPL1A and EPL1B (EPL1A/B), are known to be conserved and characteristic subunits of the NuA4-type histone acetyltransferase complex in Arabidopsis thaliana, the biological function of EPL1A/B and the mechanism by which EPL1A/B function in the complex remain unknown. Here, we report that EPL1A/B are required for the histone acetyltransferase activity of the NuA4 complex on the nucleosomal histone H4 in vitro and for the enrichment of histone H4K5 acetylation at thousands of protein-coding genes in vivo. We demonstrate that EPL1A/B are required for linking the NuA4 catalytic subunit HAM1 with accessory subunits in the NuA4 complex. EPL1A/B function redundantly in regulating plant development especially in chlorophyll biosynthesis and de-etiolation. The EPL1A/B-dependent transcription and H4K5Ac are enriched at genes involved in chlorophyll biosynthesis and photosynthesis. We also find that EAF6, another characteristic subunit of the NuA4 complex, contribute to de-etiolation. These results suggest that the Arabidopsis NuA4 complex components function as a whole to mediate histone acetylation and transcriptional activation specifically at light-responsive genes and are critical for photomorphogenesis.

By measuring the freezing tolerance of mutant lines, this study identified that the loss of HRA1, LBD41, MBF1c and JUB1 slows the rate of deacclimation in the first four days in Arabidopsis thaliana. Comparative transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) and co-expression analysis of Col-0, mbf1c and jub1 during deacclimation identified an involvement of thermoswitches, cell wall remodeler and transporters in the regulation of the rate of deacclimation. In mbf1c and jub1 a unique increase in stress responsive genes and regulation of the jasmonic acid pathway was detected and linked to the mutants’ retention of freezing tolerance during deacclimation. Hypoxia was observed to be induced in early deacclimation evidenced by an increase in ADH enzyme activity and upregulated gene expression of hypoxia markers (qRT-PCR). This work suggests that the overserved hypoxia response creates hypoxic niches within the plants and supports growth and development during deacclimation.

Methods:  Global transcriptional changes in  a newly generated over-expression line (JAR1-OE; 35S::JAR1-1-YFP)),  a T-DNA insertion line in the JAR1 locus (jar1-11;SALK_034543), and wild-type Col-0 were investigated by RNA-seq analyses of rosette leaves from 32 day-old plant that were either well-watered (control) or not watered after day 18 (drought). Plants were grown on soil under long-day conditions
Results: Under control conditions, using a stringent cut-off (DESeq, adjusted to FDR < 0.01 and LogFC ≥ 1), we found only four differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between jar1-11 and Col-0,  all of them  downregulated. By contrast, we found 339 DEGs between JAR1-OE and Col-0, of which 134 were downregulated and 205 were upregulated. A comparison of the RNA-seq data from Col-0 between control and drought conditions revealed 3401 DEGs, of which 2023 were down- and 1378 upregulated. By comparison, jar1-11 plants, which were most heavily affected by drought stress, showed a much higher number (6139 in total; 2616 up- and 3523 down-regulated) of DEGs, while the more drought-tolerant JAR1-OE line displayed a lower number (2025 in total; 971 up- and 1054 down-regulated) of DEGs.  2411 DEGs were found between Col-0 and jar1-11 under drought  among which 966 genes showed a higher and 1445 genes a lower expression level in jar1-11. On the other hand, out of 998 DEGs found between Col-0 and JAR1-OE under drought, 737 genes showed a higher and 261 genes a lower expression level in JAR1-OE. Moreover, we found 391 DEGs counter-regulated between jar1-11 and JAR1-OE.

PRJNA806785	Endosperm cellularization failure induces a dehydration stress response leading to embryo arrest (thale cress)	"The endosperm is a nutritive tissue supporting embryo growth in flowering plants. Most commonly, the endosperm initially develops as a coenocyte (multinucleate cell) and then cellularizes. This process of cellularization is frequently disrupted in hybrid seeds generated by crosses between different flowering plant species or plants that differ in ploidy, resulting in embryo arrest and seed lethality. The reason for embryo arrest upon cellularization failure remains unclear. In this study, we show that triploid Arabidopsis thaliana embryos surrounded by uncellularized endosperm mount an osmotic stress response that is connected to increased levels of abscisic acid (ABA) and enhanced ABA responses. Impairing ABA biosynthesis and signalling aggravated triploid seed abortion, while increasing endogenous ABA levels as well as the exogenous application of ABA induced endosperm cellularization and suppressed embryo growth arrest. Taking these results together, we propose that endosperm cellularization is required to establish dehydration tolerance in the developing embryo, ensuring its survival during seed maturation.

PRJNA806968	PIF7 is the master regulator of thermomorphogenesis in shade [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The size and shape of plant organs are highly responsive to the local environmental conditions. The embryonic stem, or hypocotyl, of the plant is one such organ that displays impressive phenotypic plasticity, and its length is affected by both light and temperature. After sensing surrounding vegetation, hypocotyls of shade avoiding species elongate to outcompete neighbouring plants and secure access to sunlight. A similar elongation response occurs when the plants are grown in high ambient temperatures. Previous studies have shown that this response is mediated by a family of transcription factors called PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORS (PIFs). However, it is poorly understood how environmental light and temperature interact to affect plants at the morphological and molecular levels. Here, we examine the genetic and molecular basis of the response to low R/FR under warm ambient temperatures. We found that low R/FR combined with warm temperature dominantly regulate by PIF7 and exhibit a synergistic effect on hypocotyl growth, greater than either stimulus alone. While the synergistic response was dependent on PIF7 and the plant hormone auxin, we demonstrate that additional, yet unknown key factor/s must be involved, likely working downstream of the phyB-PIF-auxin module. As shade responses are known to affect crop yield and fruit quality in many species, our findings will improve the predictions of how plants will respond to increased ambient temperatures when grown at high density, a condition in which mutual shading occurs. In addition, we point out key factors in this response that can potentially be modulated to minimize the negative effect on yield.
Overall design: Two biological replicates of wild-type seedlings grown in constant LED white light (~70µE) at 21°C in white light (WL) for three days and moved to 21°C WL supplement with Far-red (21FR; R/FR=0.6), 30°C in white light (30WL), 30°C WL supplement with Far-red (30FR; R/FR=0.6) or left at 21WL. Samples (whole seedlings) were collected after one, three, six, or 24 hours and sequenced to analyze the genes regulated by each condition. Less..."

PRJNA807727	RNAseq analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana apices of Col-0, ap2-12 and rAP2-VENUS plants at 1-cm bolting stage (thale cress)	"The APETALA2 (AP2) transcription factor regulates flower development, floral transition and shoot apical meristem (SAM) maintenance in Arabidopsis. AP2 is also regulated at the post-transcriptional level by microRNA172 (miR172), but the contribution of this to SAM maintenance is poorly understood. We generated transgenic plants carrying a form of AP2 that is resistant to miR172 (rAP2) or carrying a wild-type AP2 susceptible to miR172. Phenotypic and genetic analyses were performed on these lines and mir172 mutants to study the role of AP2 regulation by miR172 on meristem size and the rate of flower production. We found that rAP2 enlarges the inflorescence meristem by increasing cell size and cell number. Misexpression of rAP2 from heterologous promoters showed that AP2 acts in the central zone (CZ) and organizing center (OC) to increase SAM size. Furthermore, we found that AP2 is negatively regulated by AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 3 (ARF3). However, genetic analyses indicated that ARF3 also influences SAM size and flower production rate independently of AP2. The study identifies miR172/AP2 as a regulatory module controlling inflorescence meristem size and suggests that transcriptional regulation of AP2 by ARF3 fine tunes SAM size determination.

PRJNA808090	PIF4/HEMERA-mediated daytime thermosensory growth requires the Mediator subunit MED14 (thale cress)	"Warm ambient temperatures do not trigger stress responses in plants but stimulate the growth of specific organs. The basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) plays a central role in regulating thermomorphogenetic hypocotyl elongation in various plant species, including the model dicotyledonous plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Although it is well known that PIF4 promotes plant thermosensory growth by activating key genes involved in the biosynthesis and signaling of the phytohormone auxin, the detailed molecular mechanism of such transcriptional activation is still not clear. Our previous studies demonstrated that HEMERA (HMR), a transcription co-activator of PIF4, promotes the thermo-induced expression of PIF4 target genes through the nine-amino-acid transactivation domain (9aaTAD) in its carboxy-terminus. In this report, we investigate the role of the Mediator complex in the PIF4/HMR-mediated thermoresponsive gene expression. Through the characterization of various mutants of the Mediator complex, a tail subunit named MED14 is identified as an essential factor for thermomorphogenetic hypocotyl growth. MED14 is required for the thermal induction of key PIF4 target genes but has a marginal effect on the levels of PIF4 and HMR. Further transcriptomic analyses confirm that the expression of numerous PIF4/HMR-dependent, auxin-related genes requires MED14 at a warm temperature. Moreover, PIF4 and HMR physically interact with MED14 and both are indispensable for the association of MED14 with the promoters of these thermoresponsive genes. Together, these results unveil an important thermomorphogenetic mechanism, in which PIF4 and its coactivator HMR recruit the Mediator complex to activate auxin-related growth-promoting genes when plants sense moderate increases in ambient temperature.
Overall design: RNA-seq analysis was performed on Col-0 (WT), pif4-2, hmr-22, and med14 seedlings that were grown at 20°C or 27°C under continuous red light for 96 hours.

PRJNA809227	Transcriptomic analysis of IAA treated 3 DAG WT and er erl2 seedlings. (thale cress)	"Proper control of Auxin localization and accumulation are essential for leaf primordia initiation. Additionally, previous work has shown that the ERECTA family of genes also control leaf initiation. In this study we seek to understand the interaction between Auxin and the er erl2 double mutant in 3 days after germination (DAG) old seedlings. WT and mutant seedlings were either treated with IAA or mock treatments for 30 minutes. RNA was isolated and poly-A enriched strand specific libraries were constructed and paired end sequencing was carried out. The mutant showed mild, yet consistent enrichment of chloroplast and carbohydrate metabolism gene ontology terms in our mutant compared to WT. However, at 30 minutes post IAA treatment, the mutant and WT did not have significantly different responses to auxin. This indicates that the ERECTA family genes do not play a significant role in the immediate and direct response to auxin.

PRJNA809747	Transcriptome analysis of the symbiotic response of Arabidopsis at different temperatures. (thale cress)	"High ambient temperature regulated the plant systemic response to the beneficial endophytic fungus Serendipita indica.  Most plants in nature establish symbiotic associations with endophytic fungi in soil. Beneficial endophytic fungi induce a systemic response in the aboveground parts of the host plant, thus promoting the growth and fitness of host plants. Meanwhile, temperature elevation from climate change widely affects global plant biodiversity as well as crop quality and yield. Over the past decades, great progresses have been made in the response of plants to high ambient temperature and to symbiosis with endophytic fungi. However, little is known about their synergistic effect on host plants.  The endophytic fungus Serendipita indica colonizes the roots of a wide range of plants, including Arabidopsis. Based on the Arabidopsis-S. indica symbiosis experimental system, we analyzed the synergistic effect of high ambient temperature and endophytic fungal symbiosis on host plants. By transcriptome analysis, we found that DNA replication-related genes were significantly upregulated during the systemic response of Arabidopsis aboveground parts to S. indica colonization. Plant hormones, such as jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene (ET), play important roles in plant growth and systemic responses. We found that high  ambient temperature repressed the JA and ET signaling pathways of Arabidopsis aboveground parts during the systemic response to S. indica colonization in roots. Meanwhile, PIF4 is the central hub transcription factor controlling plant thermosensory growth under high ambient temperature in Arabidopsis. PIF4 is also involving JA and/or ET signaling pathway. We found that PIF4 target genes overlapped with many differentially expressed genes (DEGs) during the systemic response, and further showed that the growth promotion efficiency of S. indica on the pif4 mutant was higher than that on the wild type plants.
Overall design: The aboveground parts of S. indica-inoculated Arabidopsis at 7 dpi were harvested for transcriptome.  Arabidopsis was grown on half-strength MS medium with 1.2% sucrose (½MS). The seeds were stratified at 4°C for 3 days and then first grown at 22°C under short-day growth condition (12 h: 12 h, day: night photoperiod, 7000 LX light) in growth chambers. Serendipita indica (syn. Piriformospora indica, DSM11827) fungus were grown and conserved in PDA medium (200 g L-1 potato, 20 g L-1 dextrose and 20 g L-1 agar). For cocultivation with S. indica, 9-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings were inoculated with S. indica in PNM medium plates. S. indica-incubated (Si) and control (CK) samples were grown at 22°C, 25°C or 28°C under short-day growth condition. Less..."

PRJNA809959	Specific CBF transcription factors and cold‐responsive genes fine‐tune the early triggering response after acquisition of cold priming and memory (thale cress)	"Plants need to adapt to fluctuating temperatures throughout their lifetime. Previous research has shown that A. thaliana retains memory of a first cold stress (priming) and improves its primed freezing tolerance even further when subjected to a second similar stress after a lag phase. This study investigates primary metabolomic (gas chromatography–mass spectrometry) and transcriptomic (RNA-Seq) changes during 24 h of cold priming or cold triggering at 4°C. During triggering higher expression of genes encoding Late Embryogenesis Abundant (LEA), antifreeze proteins or proteins function as detoxifiers of reactive oxygen species (ROS) was observed compared to cold priming. Examples of early responders to triggering were xyloglucan endotransglucosylase/hydrolase genes encoding proteins involved in cell wall remodeling while late responders were identified to act in fine-tuning of stress response and development regulation. Four transcription factors, CBF2/DREB1C, CBF4/DREB1D, DDF2/DREB1E and DDF1/DREB1F were strongly and uniquely significantly induced throughout the entire triggering response. The induction of unusual members of the DREB subfamily of ERF/AP2 transcription factors, the relatively small number of induced genes of the CBF regulon and slower accumulation of selected cold stress associated metabolites proposes that a cold triggering stimulus might be sensed as milder stress in plants compared to priming. Further, the strong induction of CBF4 throughout triggering suggests a unique function of this gene during cold stress memory.
Overall design: RNA-Sequencing of a priming and triggering time course. 28 d old Arabdiopsis thaliana plants were primed (C28P) (4°C) and then subjected to a 7 day lag phase and triggered (C28PLT) (4°C).

PRJNA810713	Mutation of histone H3 serine 28 to alanine influences H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Histone modifications are essential for chromatin activity and play an important role in many biological processes. Trimethylation of histone H3K27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive modification established by Polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2). Although the presence of the histone H3 serine 28 phosphorylation (H3S28ph) modification at adjacent amino acid residues has both positive and negative effects on Polycomb silencing in mammals, little is known about the effect of H3S28ph on H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing in plants. In this study, we show that mutating H3S28A in Arabidopsis causes a dominant-negative effect that leads to an early-flowering phenotype by promoting the expression of flowering-promoting genes independently of abnormal cell division. While H3S28ph levels decreased due to the H3S28A mutation, H3K27me3 levels at the same loci did not increase. Moreover, we observed decreased H3K27me3 levels at some known PRC2 target genes in H3.3S28A transgenic lines, rather than the expected enhanced H3K27me3-mediated silencing. In line with the reduced H3K27me3 levels, the expression of the PRC2 catalytic subunits CLF and SWN decreased. Taken together, these data demonstrate that H3.3S28 is required for PRC2-dependent H3K27me3-mediated silencing in Arabidopsis, suggesting that H3S28 has a non-canonical function in H3K27me3-mediated gene silencing.

PRJNA811122	Clock controlled and cold induced CDF6 alters growth and development to changing temperatures (thale cress)	"The circadian clock represents a critical regulatory network, which allows plants to anticipate environmental changes as inputs and promote plant survival by regulating various physiological outputs. Here, we examine the function of the clock-regulated transcription factor, CYCLING DOF FACTOR 6 (CDF6), during cold stress in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the clock gates CDF6 transcript accumulation in the vasculature during cold stress. CDF6 mis-expression results in an altered flowering phenotype during both ambient and cold stress. A genome-wide transcriptome analysis links CDF6 to genes associated with flowering and seed germination during cold and ambient temperatures, respectively. Analysis of key floral regulators indicates that CDF6 alters flowering during cold stress by repressing photoperiodic flowering components, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT), CONSTANS (CO), and BROTHER OF FT (BFT). Gene ontology enrichment further suggests that CDF6 regulates circadian and developmental associated genes. These results provide insight into how the clock-controlled CDF6 modulates plant development during moderate cold stress.

P. infestans ceramide (Pi-Cer) elicitors induced ROS production while diacylglycerol (Pi-DAG) elicitors containing eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) as a substructure induced the formation of phytoalexins in potato. When Arabidopsis was treated with Pi-Cer and EPA partially overlapping but different sets of genes were induced. Furthermore simultaneous treatment with Pi-Cer and EPA did not have a cumulative effect on induced genes but rather the expression of some genes induced by EPA was attenuated by the co-treatment with Pi-Cer.

PRJDB12086	DiospyrosReinvention of hermaphroditism via activation of a RADIALIS-like gene in hexaploid persimmon	Polyploidization or genome / gene duplication events are often associated with the plasticity in sexual systems, but the exact molecular mechanisms underlying these transitions are still mostly uncharacterized. Persimmons (or the genus Diospyros) have evolved dioecy via lineage-specific paleo-duplications. More recently, hexaploid D. kaki, or Oriental persimmon, has established a monoecious phenotype, and often also exhibits reversions from male to hermaphrodite flowers, in response to natural environmental signals (Natural Hermaphroditism, NH), or to artificial cytokinin treatment (Artificial Hermaphroditism, AH). In this study, we sought to identify the molecular pathways underlying these polyploid-specific reversions to hermaphroditic flowers in D. kaki. Less...

PRJEB47659	Salicylic acid-induced gene expression in wild-type Col-0 and mutant upl1, upl5, and npr1-1 Arabidopsis thaliana plants	The plant immune hormone salicylic acid (SA) modulates transcriptional reprogramming via controlling the master transcriptional coactivator, NPR1. Here we examined the role of HECT-type ubiquitin ligases, UPL1 and UPL5, in SA/NPR1-dependent transcriptional control. We showed that UPL1 and UPL5 are essential regulators of SA-responsive genes, and regulate SA-induced transcriptional reprogramming in a NPR1-dependent manner. Four-week old Arabidopsis thaliana plants of wild-type Col-0, mutant upl1, mutant upl5, and mutant npr1-1 genotypes were germinated on soil in 100% relative humidity. Plants were continuously grown in an environmental chamber with 16/8 hour day/night light regime (120 mol m-2 s-1 light intensity), 21/18 degrees celcius day/night cycle and 65% relative humidity. 4-week-old plants were sprayed with water or 0.5 mM SA until all leaves were thoroughly covered with fine droplets, samples were collected after 24 hours treatment. In total two independent biological repeats were collected. Less...

The ethylene signalling pathway is modulated by the master transcription factor EIN3. Here we examined the involvement of proteasome-associated UPL3 and UPL4 ubiquitin ligases in ethylene-responsive gene expression. We reveal that in absence of functional UPL3 and UPL4, plants show constitutive and enhanced activation or repression of ethylene-responsive genes in an EIN3-dependent manner.  Ten-day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings of wild-type Col-0,  mutant upl3 upl4, mutant ein3-1, and mutant upl3 upl4 ein3-1 were grown on MS media in an environmental chamber with 16/8 hour day/night light regime (120 mol m-2 s-1 light intensity) and 22 degrees Celsius. Seedlings were then transferred to 6-well plates and floated on the surface of water or 50 uM 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC). After 3 hours seedlings were harvested and for each treatment ~50 seedlings were pooled together into a single biological repeat. In total three independent biological repeats were collected. After harvesting seedlings were briefly dried on tissue and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until further analysis. Less...

PRJEB35753	HUB2 influences lignification	"PIRIN2 (PRN2) was earlier reported as the first known molecular player in the regulation of non-cell-autonomous lignification of xylem vessels in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana).
In the present study we characterized HUB2 (HISTONE MONOUBIQUITINATION2), one of the protein interactors of PRN2, in relation to lignification. Thus we aim to broaden the understanding of non-cell-autonomous lignification and simultaneously provide new information on a protein, which was previously characterized in other aspects of plant development.
Protein interaction was tested by yeast two-hybrid assay, beta-galactosidase enzymatic assay and co-immunoprecipitation assay. The morphology and chemical composition of secondary cell walls of Arabidopsis stems and/or hypocotyls was determined by transmission electron microscopy and pyrolysis-gas chromatography/mass spectrometry. Fourier Transform Infrared (FT-IR) and Raman microspectroscopy were employed for the chemical fingerprinting of individual xylem cell walls.
HUB2 promoted the deposition of S-type lignin and suppressed the accumulation of G-type lignin in the secondary cell walls of xylem vessels. Transcriptome analysis revealed that PRN2 and HUB2 antagonistically regulate the expression of specific lignin-related genes, and thus lignification. Less..."

PRJEB36195	A role of Jasmonate in adventitious rooting in Arabidopsis	"Jasmonate (JA) controls plethora of developmental processes including adventitious root initiation (ARI). We have previously shown that auxin signaling promotes ARI by antagonizing with MYC2-dependent JA signaling. To get mechanistic insights into the role of MYC2-mediated JA signaling in this process, we performed RNA-seq between ninja myc2-322B double mutant (which produce very few AR) and the wild-type seedlings at different three stages of ARI (darkness at T0, just before exposure of some of the etiolated seedlings to light. Further samples were collected after 9 and 24 h in long-day conditions (T9 and T24, respectively).  We identified several differentially expressed genes. Among the candidate genes we retrieved ERF115 transcription factor, which belongs to AP2/ETHYLENE RESPONSE FACTOR family. Interestingly, the overexpressing ERF115 line (35S:ERF115) phenocopied ninja myc2-322B in term of AR number, suggesting a genetic link between MYC2 and ERF115 genes. We demonstrated that ERF115 represses ARI by activating the cytokinin signaling machinery. Altogether, our data suggest that JA-induced ERF115 acts as a ""molecular switch"" for auxin and CK interplay during ARI. Less..."

PRJEB44359	Principles of mRNA targeting and regulation via Arabidopsis YTHDF proteins	Post-transcriptional gene regulation dependent on N6-methyladenosine (m6A) in mRNA involves RNA-binding proteins that recognize m6A through a YTH domain.  Here, we determine targets of the Arabidopsis YTH-domain protein ECT2, using a combination of two orthogonal methodologies: UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP) and the proximity-labeling method HyperTRIBE (targets of RNA binding proteins identified by editing), the latter of which was also used to determine targets for the YTH-domain protein ECT3. We further constructed Smart-seq2 libraries from isolated ECT2 mCherry-expressing protoplasted root cell populations with or without ECT2/3/4 function, comparing them to standard RNA-seq for DAG4 in roots and analysing the abundance effects and polyadenylation site usage on ECT2/3 mRNA targets. Overall, our data help to clarify the principles underlying mRNA recognition and regulation by ECT2 and other plant YTHDF proteins. Less...

PRJEB46420	Ecc_finder: a robust and accurate tool for detecting extrachromosomal circular DNA from sequencing dataEcc_finder is a comprehensive tool to detect extrachromosomal circular DNA from short and long read sequencing	Extrachromosomal circular DNA (eccDNA) has been observed in different species for decades, and more and more evidence shows that this special type of DNA molecules may play an important role in rapid adaptation. Therefore, characterizing the full landscape of eccDNA has become critical, and there are several protocols for enriching eccDNA and performing short-read or long-read sequencing. However, there currently are no tools available to specifically identify eccDNA from Nanopore reads. More importantly, the current tools based on Illumina short reads lack an efficient standardized pipeline, do not consider repeated loci and cannot be applied to very large genomes. Here we introduce a comprehensive tool to solve both of these two issues (https://github.com/njaupan/ecc_finder). Applying ecc_finder to eccDNA-seq (we named mobilome-seq, Circle-Seq and CIDER-seq uniformly here as eccDNA-seq) data from Arabidopsis, human, and wheat (with genome sizes ranging from 120 Mb to 17 Gb), we document the improvement of computational time, sensitivity, and accuracy and demonstrate its wide applicability and functionality.

PRJEB46544	met3 and met3fie transcriptome	Complex epigenetic changes occur during plant reproduction. These regulations ensure the proper transmission of epigenetic information as well as allowing for zygotic totipotency. In Arabidopsis, the main DNA methyltransferase is called MET1 and is responsible for methylating cytosine in the CG context. The Arabidopsis genome encodes for three additional reproduction-specific homologs of MET1, namely MET2a, MET2b and MET3. In this paper, we show that the DNA methyltransferase MET3 is expressed in the seed endosperm and its expression is further restricted to the chalazal endosperm. MET3 is biallelically expressed in the endosperm but displays a paternal expression bias. We found that MET3 expression is regulated by the Polycomb complex proteins FIE and MSI1. Seed development is not impaired in met3 mutant, and we could not observe significant transcriptional changes in met3 mutant. Interestingly, we found that MET3 regulates gene expression in a Polycomb mutant background suggesting a further complexification of the interplay between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation in the seed endosperm.

PRJEB47134	Energy status-promoted growth and development of Arabidopsis require copper deficiency response transcriptional regulator SPL7	Copper (Cu) is a cofactor of around 300 Arabidopsis proteins including photosynthetic and mitochondrial electron transfer chain enzymes critical for ATP production and carbon fixation. Plant acclimation to Cu deficiency requires the transcription factor SQUAMOSA PROMOTER-BINDING PROTEIN-LIKE7 (SPL7). We report that in the wild type and in the spl7-1 mutant, respiratory electron flux via Cu-dependent cytochrome c oxidase remained unaffected under both normal and low-Cu cultivation conditions. Contrary to the wild type, supplementing Cu-deficient media with exogenous sugar failed to stimulate growth of spl7-1. The spl7-1 mutant accumulated carbohydrates including the signaling sugar trehalose 6-phosphate, as well as ATP and NADH, also under normal Cu supply and without sugar supplementation. Late flowering of spl7 1 was in agreement with its attenuated sugar responsiveness. Functional TOR and SnRK1 kinase signaling in spl7-1 suggested against fundamental defects in these energy-signaling hubs. Sequencing of chromatin immunoprecipitates combined with transcriptomics identified direct targets of SPL7-mediated positive regulation, including FE SUPEROXIDE DISMUTASE1 (FSD1), COPPER-DEFICIENCY-INDUCED TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR1 (CITF1) and uncharacterized bHLH23 (CITF2), as well as an enriched upstream GTACTRC motif. In summary, transducing energy availability into growth and reproductive development requires the function of SPL7. Our results could help to increase crop yields, especially on Cu-deficient soils.

We also observed this ecotype-specific leaf deformation in the case of turnip mosaic virus (TuMV) infection. These observations suggested that there are genetic differences in the hosts that determine this response. We also expected that this differential regulation will manifest in the transcriptome or sRNAome profiles and by comparing these profiles we will be able to find the host factors responsible for the ecotype-specific symptom development. Indeed, the comparative transcriptome analysis of the TVCV-, TuMV- and mock-infected Col-0 and Bur-0 plants resulted in a few candidate genes that could be responsible for the leaf deformation. Some of these genes are known regulators of leaf polarity while others may represent novel, ecotype-specific functions in leaf development or other biological processes that are commonly disturbed by TVCV and TuMV infection.

PRJNA812339	The Arabidopsis Hippo/SIK1 negatively regulates Jasmonate signaling	Everything that has a beginning has an end. For animals, growth stops when organs reach their target size. The Hippo signaling pathway is an evolutionarily conserved pathway that restricts organ size by inhibiting cell proliferation and promoting cell death. Hence this pathway is vital in both organ regeneration and cancer development, and timing is essential. In plants, when an insect bites a leaf, the plant hormone jasmonates (JA) act right after wounding to terminate plant growth and to initiate defense. When JA signaling is on, amino acid-conjugated JA binds to its receptor, the LRR and RING domain protein COI1, which also acts as a F-box protein in SCFCOI1 ubiquitin ligase that labels the transcription repressors, the JAZ proteins, for degradation. Then the key transcription factor in JA signaling, MYC2, is free to promote JA-responsive gene expression. How MYC2 activity and JA signaling is terminated is not fully understood. We found out that the Arabidopsis Hippo ortholog, SIK1, acts on MYC2 to repress JA signaling. SIK1 mRNA and protein levels themselves are induced by JA for a timely ending of JA signaling. In this RNA-seq dataset, we found out that sik1 has reduced JA signaling, and that sik1 myc2 is similar to myc2 in its transcriptome, validating the genetic interactions between SIK1 and MYC2.

PRJNA792926	Arabidopsis Transcription Factor TCP4 Represses Petal Greening by Inhibiting Chlorophyll Biosynthesis	Green petals pose a challenge for pollinators to distinguish flowers from leaves, but are valuable as a specialty flower trait. However, little is understood about the molecular mechanisms underlying the development of green petals. Here, we report that CINCINNATA (CIN)-like TEOSINTE BRANCHED 1/ CYCLOIDEA/ PCF (TCP) proteins play key roles in control of petal color. The septuple tcp2/3/4/5/10/13/17 mutant produced flowers with green petals due to chlorophyll accumulation. Expression of TCP4 complemented the petal phenotype of tcp2/3/4/5/10/13/17 . We found that chloroplasts were converted into leucoplasts in the distal parts of wild-type petals, but not in the proximal parts, during flower development, while plastid conversion was compromised in the distal parts of tcp2/3/4/5/10/13/17 petals. TCP4 and most CIN -like TCPs were predominantly expressed in distal petal regions, consistent with the greenwhite pattern in wild-type petals and the petal greening observed in the distal parts oftcp2/3/4/5/10/13/17 petals. RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq) data revealed that mostchlorophyll biosynthesis genes were down-regulated in the white distal parts of wildtype petals, but these genes had elevated expression in the distal green parts of tcp2/3/4/5/10/13/17 petals and the green proximal parts of wild-type petals. We revealed that TCP4 repressed chlorophyll biosynthesis by directly binding to thepromoters of PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE REDUCTASE ( PORB ), DIVINYLREDUCTASE ( DVR ) and SUPPRESSOR OF OVEREXPRESSION OF CO 1 ( SOC1), which are known to promote petal greening. We found that the conversion ofchloroplasts to leucoplasts and green coloration in the proximal parts of petalsappeared to be conserved among plant species. Our findings uncover a mainmolecular mechanism underpinning the formation of petal color patterns and provide a foundation for breeding of plants with green flowers. Less...

PRJNA785782	The transcriptional repressor TIE2 dampens cytokinin response during root development	Cytokinin plays critical roles in root development. Cytokinin signaling depends on activation of the key transcription factor type B Arabidopsis Response Regulators (ARRs). However, the mechanisms underlying the finely tuned regulation of type B ARR activity remain to be clarified. In this study, we demonstrate that the ERF-associated amphiphilic repression (EAR) motif-containing protein TCP INTERACTOR CONTAINING EAR MOTIF PROTEIN2 (TIE2) forms a negative feedback loop to finely tune the activity of type B ARRs during root development. Disruption of TIE2 and its close homolog TIE1 causes severely shortened roots. TIE2 interacts with type B ARR1 and represses transcription of ARR1 targets. The cytokinin response is correspondingly enhanced in tie1-1 tie2-1. We further show that ARR1 positively regulates TIE1 and TIE2 by directly binding to their promoters. Our findings demonstrate that TIE2 plays key roles in controlling root morphology, and reveal an important negative feedback regulation mechanism for cytokinin signaling. Less...

PRJNA748845	H3-ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq in A.thaliana SPT16 phospho-mutant lines	FACT consisting of SSRP1 and SPT16 is conserved in a wide variety of plant species. FACT can disassemble and reassemble nucleosomes; thereby it is involved in both overcoming and maintaining the nucleosomal barrier to DNA-dependent processes in the chromatin context. There is only limited information about the potential regulation of FACT function via post-translational modifications. We mutated several identified SPT16 phosphorylation sites followed by RNA-Seq and H3-ChIP-Seq as a measurement for total genome-wide nucleosome occupany in the mutant lines. The expression of a non-phosphorylatable SPT16 variant results in a distinct rearrangement of H3. Less...	
PRJNA717394	Functional characterization of miR858 from Arabidopsis thaliana	miR858 is a potential regulator of the phenylpropanoid pathway and plant development. miR858a targets R2R3-MYB transcription factors involved in flavonoid biosynthesis. miR858OX plants show robust growth and early flowering in contrast to the reduction of plant growth and delayed flowering observed in Arabidopsis transgenic lines expressing an artificial miRNA target mimic (MIM858). In this project, the global changes occurring in the rosette and stem tissues of miR858OX and MIM858 were analyzed through transcriptome analysis. The study identified a large number of differentially expressed genes related to growth and development in miR858OX and MIM858 lines compared to WT plants. A number of differentially expressed genes encoding small peptides were also identified in the study. Less...

PRJNA731383	Positive Selection and Heat-Response Transcriptomes Reveal Adaptive Features of the Arabidopsis Desert Relative, Anastatica hierochuntica	Extremophytes have evolved genetic adaptations for tolerance to abiotic stresses characteristic of their extreme environments. Comparative molecular analyses of Arabidopsis thaliana with its halophytic Brassicaceae relatives have revealed that the halophytes exist in a pre-adapted, stress-ready state. We generated a reference transcriptome of the heat-tolerant A. thaliana desert relative, Anastatica hierochuntica (True Rose of Jericho) and used two approaches to identify genetic adaptations that could facilitate an extremophyte lifestyle: (i) We identified positively selected genes indicative of common selective pressures in different extreme environments that target stomatal opening, nutrient acquisition, and UV-B induced DNA repair. In A. hierochuntica, we specifically identified genes consistent with a photoperiod-insensitive, early flowering phenotype that could be advantageous in the desert environment; (ii) Using RNA-seq analysis, we demonstrate that A. thaliana and A. hierochuntica transcriptomes exhibit similar transcriptional adjustment in response to heat and that the A. hierochuntica transcriptome does not exist in a stress-ready state, unlike its halophytic relatives. Furthermore, the A. hierochuntica global transcriptome, as well as orthologs belonging to specific functional groups, display a lower basal and higher heat-induced fold-change expression than A. thaliana. We suggest that these transcriptome features are related to specific conditions native to a desert environment. Less...

PRJNA705300	Raw reads of direct RNA sequencing of Toxoplasma gondii and Arabidopsis thaliana in the context m6A writter/reader protein knockouts	Correct 3prime end processing of mRNAs is regarded as one of the regulatory cornerstones of gene expression. In a parasite that must answer to the high regulatory requirements of its multi-host life style, there is a great need to adopt additional means to partition the distinct transcriptional signatures of the closely and tandemly-arranged stage specific genes. In this study, we report on our findings in T. gondii of an m6A-dependent 3prime end polyadenylation serving as a transcriptional barrier at these loci. We identify the core polyadenylation complex within T. gondii and establish CPSF4 as a reader for m6A-modified mRNAs, via a YTH domain within its C-terminus, a feature which is shared with plants. We bring evidence of the specificity of this interaction both biochemically, and by determining the crystal structure at high resolution of the T. gondii CPSF4-YTH in complex with an m6A modified RNA. We show that the loss of m6A, both at the level of its deposition or its recognition was associated with an increase in aberrantly elongated chimeric mRNAs emanating from impaired transcriptional termination, a phenotype previously noticed in the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana. We bring Nanopore direct RNA sequencing-based evidence of the occurrence of transcriptional read-through breaching into downstream repressed stage-specific genes, in the absence of either CPSF4 or the m6A RNA methylase components in both T. gondii and A. thaliana. Taken together, our results shed light on an essential regulatory mechanism coupling the pathways of m6A metabolism directly to the cleavage and polyadenylation processes, one that interestingly seem to serve, in both T. gondii and A. thaliana, as a guardian against aberrant transcriptional read-throughs.

PRJNA726938	The Cytonuclear Dimension of Allopolyploidy	Two central themes in plant genomics have fully emerged in recent years: (1) polyploidy has beenpervasive in shaping the diversity of crops and their wild relatives, and (2) epistatic interactions betweencytoplasmic (i.e., mitochondrial and plastid) and nuclear genomes are complex and key to determiningthe outcome of hybridization/introgression. However, remarkably little attention has been paid to therelationship between polyploidy and cytonuclear interactions, even though the generation of polyploids isexpected to perturb the stoichiometric and epistatic basis of these interactions. The research programpresented here will address this gap by performing genome-wide, hypothesis-based tests of the effects ofmerging two or more differentiated genomes on cytonuclear interactions, using five model genera thatspan the diversity of crops and allopolyploid angiosperms. The research will be integrated with outreachand education efforts from the middle-school level up to high school teachers and university faculty, alltoward broadening participation in computational biology, plant genomics, and scientific research moregenerally.

PRJNA733570	Endophytic Bacillus altitudinis enhance plant growth.	The identification and use of endophytic bacteria capable of triggering plant growth is an important aim in sustainable agriculture. In nature, plants live in alliance with multiple plant growth-promoting endophytic microorganisms. In the current study, we isolated and identified a new endophytic bacterium from a wild plant species Glyceria chinensis (Keng). The bacterium was designated as a Bacillus altitudinis strain using 16S rDNA sequencing. The endophytic B. altitudinis had a notable influence on plants growth. Results of our assays revealed that the endophytic B. altitudinis raised the growth of different plant species. Remarkably, we found transcriptional changes in plants treated with the bacterium. Genes such as maturase K, TPR-like superfamily protein, LOB domain-containing protein, and BTB/POZ / TAZ domain-containing protein were highly expressed. In addition, we identified for first-time the induction in the endophytic bacterium of MFS transporter and DNA gyrase subunit B genes during interaction with the plant. These new findings show that endophytic B. altitudinis could be used as a favourable candidate source to enhance plants growth in sustainable agriculture. Less...

PRJNA603477	PAMP-triggered genetic reprogramming involves widespread alternative transcription initiation and an immediate transcription factor wave (thale cress)	"Immune responses triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are key to pathogen defense, but drivers and stabilizers of the growth-to-defense genetic reprogramming remain incompletely understood in plants. Here, we report a time-course study of the establishment of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) using cap analysis of gene expression. We show that around 15% of all transcription start sites (TSSs) rapidly induced during PTI define alternative transcription initiation events. From these, we identify clear examples of regulatory TSS change via alternative inclusion of target peptides or domains in encoded proteins, or of upstream open reading frames in mRNA leader sequences. We also find that 60% of PAMP response genes respond earlier than previously thought. In particular, a cluster of rapidly and transiently PAMP-induced genes is enriched in transcription factors (TFs) whose functions, previously associated with biological processes as diverse as abiotic stress adaptation and stem cell activity, appear to converge on growth restriction. Furthermore, examples of known potentiators of PTI, in one case under direct mitogen-activated protein kinase control, support the notion that the rapidly induced TFs could constitute direct links to PTI signaling pathways and drive gene expression changes underlying establishment of the immune state.

PRJNA632011	Dissecting the co-transcriptome landscape of plants and microbiota	"Interactions between plants and each neighboring microbial species are fundamental building blocks that collectively determine the structure and function of the plant microbiota, but the molecular basis of such interactions is poorly characterized. Here, we monocolonized Arabidopsis leaves with nine plant-associated bacteria from all major phyla of the plant microbiota and profiled co-transcriptomes of plants and bacteria. These strains elicited quantitatively different plant transcriptional responses including typical pattern-triggered immunity responses. Genes of non-pathogenic bacteria involved in general metabolism and energy production were commonly suppressed in planta in contrast to a virulent pathogen. Various nutrient acquisition pathways that are frequently encoded in the genomes of plant-associated bacteria were induced in planta in a strain-specific manner, shedding light on bacterial adaptation to the plant environment and identifying a potential driving force of niche separation. Integrative analyses of plant and bacterial transcriptomes suggested that the transcriptional reprogramming of plants is largely uncoupled from that of bacteria at an early stage of interactions. This study provides insights into how plants discriminate among bacterial strains and sets the foundation for in-depth mechanistic dissection of plant-microbiota interactions.

PRJNA672885	Arabidopsis MORC proteins function in the efficient establishment of RNA directed DNA methylation (thale cress)	"The Microrchidia (MORC) family of ATPases are required for transposable element (TE) silencing and heterochromatin condensation in plants and animals, and C. elegans MORC-1 has been shown to topologically entrap and condense DNA. In Arabidopsis thaliana, mutation of MORCs has been shown to reactivate silent methylated genes and transposons and to decondense heterochromatic chromocenters, despite only minor changes in the maintenance of DNA methylation. Here we provide the first evidence localizing Arabidopsis MORC proteins to specific regions of chromatin and find that MORC4 and MORC7 are closely co-localized with sites of RNA directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We further show that MORC7, when tethered to DNA by an artificial zinc finger, can facilitate the establishment of RdDM. Finally, we show that MORCs are required for the efficient RdDM mediated establishment of DNA methylation and silencing of a newly integrated FWA transgene, even though morc mutations have no effect on the maintenance of preexisting methylation at the endogenous FWA gene. We propose that MORCs function as a molecular tether in RdDM complexes to reinforce RdDM activity for methylation establishment. These findings have implications for MORC protein function in a variety of other eukaryotic organisms.
Overall design: This dataset includes ChIP-seq, RNA-seq and BS-seq to understand the molecular mechanism of Arabidopsis MORC proteins in the efficient establishment of RNA directed DNA methylation.

PRJNA699246	Arabidopsis RPD3-type histone deacetylases form multiple plant-specific complexes that are required for preventing overexpression of stress-induced genes (RNA-Seq) (thale cress)	"Although the Arabidopsis thaliana RPD3-type histone deacetylases have been known to form SIN3 histone deacetylase complexes that are conserved in eukaryotes, it is unknown whether they also form other types of histone deacetylase complexes. Here, we performed affinity purification followed by mass spectrometry and demonstrated that the Arabidopsis RPD3-type histone deacetylases HDA6 and HDA19 can interact with several previously uncharacterized proteins and form three types of plant-specific histone deacetylase complexes, which we named SANT, ESANT, and ARID. RNA-seq indicated that HDA6 and HDA19 function together with other components of the histone deacetylase complexes and co-regulate the expression of a number of genes. HDA6 and HDA19 have been thought to repress gene transcription by histone deacetylation. We found that the histone deacetylase complexes can also repress gene expression via certain histone-deacetylation-independent mechanisms. In the mutants of the histone deacetylase complexes, the expression of a number of stress-induced genes was up-regulated. Several mutants of the histone deacetylase complexes showed severe retardation in growth. Considering that the growth retardation is thought to be a trade-off for the increase of stress tolerance, we predict that the histone deacetylase complexes identified in this study prevent overexpression of stress-induced genes and thereby ensure normal growth of plants under non-stress conditions.

In this study, we demonstrate that B-BOX PROTEIN 11 (BBX11) physically interacts with both phyB and PIF4. BBX11 negatively regulates PIF4 accumulation as well as its biochemical activity, consequently leading to the repression of PIF4-controlled genes' expression and promotion of photomorphogenesis in the prolonged red light. This study reveals a regulatory mechanism that mediates red light signal transduction and sheds a light on phyB-PIF4 module in promoting red light-dependent photomorphognenesis.

PRJNA695076	An siRNA-guided AGO protein recruits Polymerase V to initiate RNA-directed DNA methylation (BSA-seq dataset) (thale cress)	"Foreign DNA is silenced in plants by small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RNA Polymerase V (Pol V) is the key protein required to recruit DNA methyltransferases to a RdDM target region. However, the mechanism required for the initial recruitment of Pol V to a targeted locus remains a mystery. In this study, we used first generation (T1) transgene transformations to elucidate a novel mechanism by which Pol V is recruited to both new transgenic and endogenous loci. This study is heavily dependent on analyzing the DNA methylation pattern and small RNAs produced from specific loci. All small RNA sequences (sRNA-seq) and bisulfite converted amplicon sequencing data (BSAS) used in this study are submitted as part of this data series.
Overall design: Examination of DNA methylation of specific loci in wild-type Columbia or mutant plants with or without transformation of specific transgenes. Each sequenced library contains amplicons for all the loci investigated in the corresponding genomic background including an unmethylated control locus AT2G20610.

PRJNA701247	Ribosomes act as cryosensors in plants (thale cress)	"Cold temperatures are a threat to temperate plants, and Arabidopsis thaliana has acquired an adaptive gene expression network controlled by CBF transcription factors. The CBFs are sufficient to enable plants to survive otherwise lethal subzero temperatures. Constitutive CBF expression causes delayed flowering and stunted growth, and plants have evolved the ability to restrict CBF expression to occur only in the cold. This allows plants to anticipate likely freezing events and selectively deploy cold tolerance. The mechanism by which cold stress is sensed is however unknown. Here we show that protein translation rates in plants are proportional to temperature, and reduced translation rates trigger a rise in intracellular free calcium that activates the CAMTA transcription factors, and these directly activate cold-induced gene expression.
Overall design: Single samples were taken at each time point. RNA-Seqs and ChIP-Seqs were performed for different genotypes at different temperature and objective time. Less..."	
PRJNA701753	Antagonistic activities of co-transcriptional regulators within an early developmental window sets quantitative FLC expression (thale cress)	"Quantitative variation in expression of the Arabidopsis floral repressor FLC influences whether plants overwinter before flowering or have a rapid cycling habit, enabling multiple generations a year. Genetic analysis has identified activators and repressors of FLC expression, but how they interact to set expression level is poorly understood. Here, we show that antagonistic functions of the FLC activator FRIGIDA (FRI), and the repressor FCA, at a specific stage of embryo development, determines FLC expression and flowering. FRI antagonizes an FCA-induced proximal polyadenylation to increase FLC expression and delay flowering. Sector analysis shows that FRI activity during the early heart stage of embryo development maximally delays flowering. Opposing functions of co-transcriptional regulators during an early embryonic developmental window thus set FLC expression levels and determine flowering time.

PRJNA702130	Karrikins control seedling photomorphogenesis through the HY5-BBX transcriptional module. (thale cress)	"Karrikins (KARs) are a class of butenolide molecules found in the smoke of burned plant material that can induce germination of many plant species that emerge after fire. Intriguingly, KAR perception is widely conserved and not limited to fire-followers. For example, germination of dormant Arabidopsis thaliana seeds can also be stimulated by KARs. Additionally, KAR treatment enhances responses of seedlings to light. These responses include inhibition of hypocotyl elongation, enhancement of cotyledon expansion, and transcriptional upregulation of light-responsive genes not only in Arabidopsis but also in Brassica tournefortii.   Although the core KAR signaling mechanism, consisting of KAI2-SCF/MAX2-mediated degradation of SMAX1 and SMXL2, is well described, it remains elusive how SMXL degradation leads to downstream growth responses. In this study, we analyse the role of BBX20 in the KAR signaling pathway through both chemical and genetic approaches using knock-out mutants. We find that BBX20, together with its close homologue BBX21, is essential for KAR-induced inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and anthocyanin accumulation. Our detailed genetic analysis suggests that BBX20 and BBX21 act in a HY5-dependent transcriptional module downstream of SMAX1 and SMXL2. While RNA-seq analysis revealed large-scale transcriptional changes in the smax1 smxl2 mutant, our results clearly suggest that BBX20 and BBX21 are required for a subset of SMAX1/SMXL2-dependent transcriptional regulation. Overall, our data suggest that the KAR signaling pathway promotes the activity of the HY5-BBX transcriptional module and that this module represents a point of convergence between KAR and light signaling.
Overall design: RNA-seq analysis of bbx2021 and smax1 smxl2 Arabidopsis seedlings grown for 4 days in red light, in triplicate, using RNA-seq analysis Less..."

We also isolated an atxr6 null allele which showed that ATXR5 and ATXR6 are required for female germline development. Finally, we characterize three previously reported suppressors of the hypomorphic atxr5/6 mutant and show that these rescue atxr5/6 via distinct mechanisms, two of which involve increasing H3K27me1 levels.

PRJNA703045	Single-Cell Resolution of Lineage Trajectories in the Arabidopsis Stomatal Lineage and Developing Leaf (thale cress)	"Dynamic cell identities underlie flexible developmental programs. The stomatal lineages in the Arabidopsis leaf epidermis feature asynchronous and indeterminate divisions that can be modulated by environmental cues. The products of these lineages, stomatal guard cells and pavement cells, regulate plant-atmosphere exchanges, and the epidermis as a whole influences overall leaf growth. How flexibility is encoded in development of the stomatal lineage, and how cell fates are coordinated in the leaf are open questions. Here, we offer single-cell transcriptomes to uncover models of cell differentiation within Arabidopsis leaf tissue.

PRJNA704076	A domesticated Harbinger transposase forms a complex with HDA6 and promotes histone H3 deacetylation at genes but not TEs in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"In eukaryotes, histone acetylation is a major modification on histone N-terminal tails that is tightly connected to transcriptional activation. HDA6 is a histone deacetylase involved in the transcriptional regulation of genes and transposable elements (TEs) in Arabidopsis thaliana. HDA6 has been shown to participate in several complexes in plants, including a conserved SIN3 complex. Here, we uncover a novel protein complex containing HDA6, several Harbinger transposon-derived proteins (HHP1, SANT1, SANT2, SANT3, and SANT4), and MBD domain-containing proteins (MBD1, MBD2, and MBD4). We show that mutations of all four SANT genes in the sant-null mutant cause increased expression of the flowering repressors FLC, MAF4, and MAF5, resulting in a late flowering phenotype. Transcriptome deep sequencing reveals that while the SANT proteins and HDA6 regulate the expression of largely overlapping sets of genes, TE silencing is unaffected in sant-null mutants. Our global histone H3 acetylation profiling shows that SANT proteins and HDA6 modulate gene expression through deacetylation. Collectively, our findings suggest that Harbinger transposon-derived SANT domain-containing proteins are required for histone deacetylation and flowering time control in plants.
Overall design: For RNA-seq: three independent biological replicates of wild-type(Col-0), hhp1, mbd 1/2/4, sant1234-null and hda6 were used for RNA deep sequencing assay.

PRJNA704712	Innate, translation-dependent silencing of an invasive transposon in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Co-evolution between hosts' and parasites' genomes shapes diverse pathways of acquired immunity based on silencing small (s)RNAs. In plants, sRNAs cause heterochromatinization, sequence-degeneration and, ultimately, loss-of-autonomy of most transposable elements (TEs). Recognition of newly-invasive plant TEs, by contrast, involves an innate antiviral-like silencing response. To investigate this response's activation, we studied the single-copy element EVADÉ (EVD), one of few representatives of the large Ty1/Copia family able to proliferate in Arabidopsis when epigenetically-reactivated. In Ty1/Copia-elements, a short subgenomic mRNA (shGAG) provides the necessary excess of structural GAG protein over the catalytic components encoded by the full-length genomic flGAG-POL. We show here that the predominant cytosolic distribution of shGAG strongly favors its translation over mostly-nuclear flGAG-POL. During this process, an unusually intense ribosomal stalling event coincides with mRNA breakage yielding unconventional 5'OH RNA fragments that evade RNA-quality-control. The starting-point of sRNA production by RNA-DEPENDENT-RNA-POLYMERASE-6 (RDR6), exclusively on shGAG, occurs precisely at this breakage point. This hitherto-unrecognized ""translation-dependent silencing"" (TdS) is independent of codon-usage or GC-content and is not observed on TE remnants populating the Arabidopsis genome, consistent with their poor association, if any, with polysomes. We propose that TdS forms a primal defense against EVD de novo invasions that underlies its associated sRNA pattern.
Overall design: Ribo-seq and sRNA-seq were performed on RNA from inflorescence tissue of EVD and GFP-EVD-GUS overexpressing plants.

REF6-mediated H3K27 demethylation promotes germination but does not significantly contribute to H3K27me3 dynamics during germination, but rather stably establishes an H3K27me3-depleted state permissive to transcription.

After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq2000 platform and paired-end reads were generated. Clean reads were obtained by removing low quality reads, reads containing adapter and ploy-N from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content the clean data were calculated.

PRJNA705878	mRNA-profiles of Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) roots infected with Fusarium oxysporum 5176 over a time course of six days	"Background: Cell walls (CWs) are protein-rich polysaccharide matrices essential for plant growth and environmental acclimationadaptation. The CW constitutes the first physical barrier as well as a primary source of sugars for plant microbes, such as the  vascular pathogen Fusarium oxysporum (Fo). Fo colonizes roots, advancing through the plant primary CWs towards the vasculature, where it grows causing devastation in many crops. The pathogenicity of Fo and other vascular microbes relies on their capacity to reach and colonize the xylem. However, little is known about the root-microbe interaction before the pathogen reaches the vasculature and the role of the plant CW during this process.
Results: Using the pathosystem Arabidopsis-Fo5176, we show dynamic transcriptional changes in both fungus and root during their interaction. One of the earliest plant responses to Fo5176 was the downregulation of primary CW synthesis genes. We observed enhanced resistance to Fo5176 in Arabidopsis mutants impaired in primary CW cellulose synthesis. Previous studies showed an induction of ectopic lignification, accumulation of defense-related phytohormones, and dwarfism in primary CW cellulose synthesis deficient plants, potentially explaining their resistance to Fo5176. We confirmed that Arabidopsis roots deposit lignin in response to Fo5176 infection but we show that lignin-deficient mutants were as susceptible as wildtype plants to Fo5176. Genetic impairment of jasmonic acid biosynthesis and signaling did not alter Arabidopsis response to Fo5176, whereas impairment of ethylene signaling did increase vasculature colonization by Fo5176. AbolishingThis ethylene signaling interruption attenuated the observed resistance while maintaining the dwarfism observed in primary CW cellulose-deficient mutants. 
Conclusions: Our study provides significant insights on the dynamic root-vascular pathogen interaction at the transcriptome level and the vital role of primary CW cellulose during defense response to these pathogens. These findings represent an essential resource for the generation of plant resistance to Fo that can be transferred to other vascular pathosystems.

PRJNA706054	The INO80 chromatin remodeling complex promotes thermomorphogenesis by connecting H2A.Z eviction and active transcription in Arabidopsis[RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Global warming imposes a major threat to plant growth and crop production. In some plants including Arabidopsis thaliana, elevated temperatures induce a series of morphological and developmental adjustments, termed thermomorphogenesis to facilitate plant cooling under high-temperature conditions. Plant thermal response is suppressed by histone variant H2A.Z. At warm temperatures, H2A.Z is evicted from nucleosomes at thermo-responsive genes, resulting in their activation. However, the mechanisms that regulate H2A.Z eviction and subsequent transcription activation are largely unknown. Here, we show that the ino80 chromatin-remodeling complex (ino80-C) promotes thermomorphogenesis and activates the expression of thermo-responsive and auxin-related genes. ino80-C associates with PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), a potent regulator in thermomorphogenesis, and mediates temperature-induced H2A.Z eviction at PIF4 targets. Moreover, ino80-C directly interacts with COMPASS-like and transcription elongation factors to promote active histone modification Histone H3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) and RNA Polymerase II (RNA Pol II) elongation, leading to the thermal induction of transcription. Notably, transcription elongation factors are required for the eviction of H2A.Z at PIF4 targets, suggesting the cooperation of ino80-C and transcription elongation in H2A.Z removal. Our results demonstrate that the (PIF4)-(ino80-C)-(COMPASS-like)-(transcription elongator) module controls plant thermal response, and establish a link between H2A.Z eviction and active transcription.

PRJNA707060	Impact of the SnRK1 protein kinase on sucrose homeostasis and the transcriptome during the diel cycle (thale cress)	"Sucrose Non-Fermenting1-Related Kinase1 (SnRK1) is an evolutionarily conserved protein kinase with key functions in energy management during stress responses in plants.
To address a potential role of SnRK1 under non-stress conditions, we performed a metabolomic and transcriptomic characterization of 20 d-old rosettes of Arabidopsis SnRK1 gain- and loss-of-function mutants during the diurnal cycle.
SnRK1 manipulation altered the slope of the correlation between sucrose and trehalose 6-phosphate (Tre6P). It also modulated the flux of carbon to the tricarboxylic acid cycle downstream of Tre6P-signalling. SnRK1 depletion modified expression of SnRK1-induced genes least at the end of the day (when Tre6P levels peak) and most at the end of the night (when Tre6P levels are lowest). Expression of a subset of these genes was attenuated by inducible Tre6P accumulation in a time-of-day dependent manner. Finally, transcriptional profiling uncovered a wide impact of SnRK1 on gene expression in non-stress conditions, establishing a clear connection with iron and sulfur metabolism.
In conclusion, SnRK1 plays central functions in metabolic and transcriptional regulation in the absence of stress. SnRK1 is further involved in the reciprocal control of sucrose-driven Tre6P production and/or degradation and its activity is modulated by daily fluctuations in Tre6P levels.

PRJNA707070	RNAseq samples of CNQX treated Arabidopsis roots regenerating at different time points. (thale cress)	"Wounding is a trigger for both regeneration and defense in plants, but it is not clear if the two responses are linked by common activation or represent potential tradeoffs. While plant glutamate-like receptors (GLRs) are known to mediate defense responses, we implicate GLRs in regeneration through dynamic changes in chromatin and transcription in reprogramming cells near wound sites. Here, we show that genetic mutation and pharmacological inhibition of GLRs increases regeneration efficiency in multiple organ repair systems and plant species. Perturbation of GLR-mediated function, possibly by affecting Calcium fluxes, speeds cell division and re-specification of the stem cell niche while dampening a subset of defense responses. We show that the GLRs work through salicylic acid (SA) signaling in their effects on regeneration, with mutants in the SA receptor NPR1 partially resistant to GLR perturbation and hyper regenerative. These findings reveal a conserved mechanism that regulates a tradeoff between defense and regeneration and also offer new strategies to improve regeneration in agricultural and conservation.

"We report the application of Next-generation sequencing (NGS) for high-throughput profiling of N4-acetylcytosine (4acC) DNA modification in Arabidopsis thaliana. We find  that 4acC  peaks mostly distribute in the euchromatin regions and are present in nearly half of the protein-coding genes in Arabidopsis.  4acC mainly locates around transcription start sites (TSSs) of protein-coding genes and positively correlates with gene expression level . Compared to non-4acC marked genes, 4acC marked genes display a higher methylation level of 5mC in the CG context within coding regions, but a lower methylation level of 5mC in the CHG and CHH contexts. In addition, 4acC peaks showed higher overlaps with active histone modification marks than by chance, but similar overlaps with repressive histone modification marks.  We observed complex cooperative interactions among 4acC, 5mC, and histone modifications on gene transcription.  4acC containing genes with low level of mCG, or active histone modification marks displayed a higher expression. In sum, we have uncovered 4acC as a hitherto unknown epigenetic DNA mark that is associated with gene expression in Arabidopsis, and suggest potential cross-talks  among epigenetic marks for gene expression.

PRJNA714877	Spider mite egg extract modifies Arabidopsis response to future infestations (thale cress)	"Transcriptional plant responses are specially under the scope on herbivore oviposition studies. However, most of the information comes from Lepidopteran models, where egg laying and feeding are separate events, and little is known regarding the plant reaction to those pests where females feed and oviposit simultaneously. The present study unveiled the oviposition-induced transcriptomic response of plants to Tetranychus urticae eggs. Transcriptional evidence indicated that the early events on the plant response to the egg extract involved ATP, Ca2+ and ROS disbalances. The main phytohormones triggered were JA and ET, with which also participated secondary metabolites, volatiles and glucosinolates as defence mechanisms. Many of the regulated genes are also involved during pathogen-defence mechanisms. Negative regulation of defence mechanisms happened at 72 h. Female fertility was significantly reduced when fed on plants pre-exposed to the eggs, while feeding increased on those plants pre-exposed for 72 h.
Overall design: Three-week-old A. thaliana Columbia (Col-0) plants were treated by applying 2 μL of egg extract and 2 μL of water on controls.

PRJNA715474	FVE promotes RNA-directed DNA methylation by facilitating the association of RNA polymerase V with chromatin [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"DNA methylation can be established by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants. The association of RNA polymerase V (Pol V) with chromatin is a critical step for RdDM. While the SRA-domain-containing proteins SUVH2 and SUVH9 and the DDR complex are known to be required for the association of Pol V with chromatin, it is unknown whether the association of Pol V with chromatin requires other unidentified regulators. Here we found that SUVH9 is able to interact with a conserved histone-interaction protein, FVE, and a previously uncharacterized RRM domain-containing protein, which we named RRM1. We demonstrated that FVE facilitates the association of Pol V with chromatin and thus contributes to DNA methylation at a substantial subset of RdDM target loci, while RRM1 is only slightly involved in RdDM. FVE-dependent RdDM target loci are more abundant in gene-rich chromosome arms than FVE-independent RdDM target loci. FVE was previously shown to be a shared subunit of the RPD3-type histone deacetylase complex and the polycomb-type histone H3K27 trimethyltransferase complex, both of which are involved in transcriptional repression. This study reveals a previously uncharacterized role of FVE in RdDM and suggests that FVE may coordinate RdDM, histone deacetylation, and H3K27 trimethylation, thus ensuring transcriptional silencing of TEs in gene-rich chromosome arms to protect genes from harmful effects of potentially transcribed TEs.

PRJNA716051	Global analysis of RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase-dependent small RNAs reveals new substrates and functions for these proteins and SGS3 in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"In plants, smRNAs are often derived from long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) molecules synthesized by one of the six genomically-encoded RNA-dependent RNA Polymerase (RDR) proteins. However, the full complement of the RDR-dependent smRNAs and functions that these proteins and their RNA-binding co-factors play in plant RNA silencing has not been fully uncovered. To address this gap, we performed a global genomic analysis of all six RDRs and two of their co-factors to find new substrates for RDRs and targets of the resulting RDR-derived siRNAs to uncover new functions for these proteins in plants. Based on these analyses, we identified substrates for the three RDR clade proteins (RDR3 - 5), which had not been well-characterized previously. We also identified new substrates for the other three RDRs (RDR1, 2, and 6) as well as the RDR2 co-factor RNA-DIRECTED DNA METHYLATION 12 (RDM12) and the RDR6 co-factor SUPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3). These findings revealed that the target substrates of SGS3 are not limited to those solely utilized by RDR6, but that this protein seems to be a more general co-factor for the RDR family proteins. Additionally, we found that RDR6 and SGS3 are involved in the production of smRNAs that target transcripts related to abiotic stresses including water deprivation, salt stress, and ABA response, and as expected the levels of these mRNAs are increased in rdr6 and sgs3 mutant plants. Correspondingly, plants that lack these proteins (rdr6 and sgs3 mutants) are hypersensitive to ABA treatment, tolerant to high levels of PEG8000, and have higher survival rate under salt treatment in comparison to wild-type (Col-0). In total, our analyses have provided an extremely data-rich resource for uncovering new functions of RDR-dependent RNA silencing in plants, while also revealing a previously unexplored link between the RDR6/SGS3-dependent pathway and plant abiotic stress responses.

PRJNA716169	Gene Expression Variation in Arabidopsis Embryos at Single-Nucleus Resolution (thale cress)	"Soon after fertilization of egg and sperm, plant genomes become transcriptionally activated and drive a series of coordinated cell divisions to form the basic body plan during embryogenesis. Early embryonic cells rapidly diversify from each other, and investigation of the corresponding gene expression dynamics can help elucidate underlying cellular differentiation programs. However, current plant embryonic transcriptome datasets either lack cell-specific information or have RNA contamination from surrounding non-embryonic tissues. We have coupled fluorescence-activated nuclei sorting together with single-nucleus mRNA sequencing to construct a gene expression atlas of Arabidopsis thaliana early embryos at single-cell resolution. In addition to characterizing cell-specific transcriptomes, we found evidence that distinct epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory mechanisms operate across emerging embryonic cell types. These datasets and analyses, as well as the approach we devised, are expected to facilitate the discovery of molecular mechanisms underlying pattern formation in plant embryos.

By examining the auxin responsiveness in the shoot or the root of a dark-growh ABA biosynthesis mutant, we found that auxin relies on intact ABA biosynthesis in order to regulate aspects of transriptional output.
Overall design: All seedlings were first stratified for 2 days at 4 degress celsius and then grown under continious light for 24 hours to initiate germination, which was followed by 4 days in complete darkeness at 22 degrees celsius. At this point, the seedlings were treated with either 10uM IAA, 10uM ABA, or equivalent ethanol for mock for 2 hours using a green safe light for seedling transfer.

PRJNA717244	Genetic determinants of endophytism in the Arabidopsis root mycobiome	"Roots of Arabidopsis thaliana do not engage in symbiotic association with mycorrhizal fungi but host taxonomically diverse fungal communities that influence health and disease states. We sequenced the genomes of 41 isolates representative of the A. thaliana root mycobiota for comparative analysis with 79 other plant-associated fungi. We report that root mycobiota members evolved from ancestors having diverse lifestyles and retained diverse repertoires of plant cell wall-degrading enzymes (PCWDEs) and effector-like small secreted proteins. We identified a set of 84 gene families predicting best endophytism, including families encoding PCWDEs acting on xylan (GH10) and cellulose (AA9). These genes also belong to a core transcriptional response induced by phylogenetically-distant mycobiota members in A. thaliana roots. Recolonization experiments with individual fungi indicated that strains with detrimental effects in mono-association with the host not only colonize roots more aggressively than those with beneficial activities but also dominate in natural root samples. We identified and validated the pectin degrading enzyme family PL1_7 as a key component linking aggressiveness of endophytic colonization to plant health.
Overall design: We report the transcriptomes of six root mycobiota members in interaction in mono-association with their host Arabidopsis thaliana in gnotobiotic system. The six fungal strains used in this experiment were isolated from the roots of healthy Arabidopsis plants in the wild (Duran et al. 2018). To identify the genes they express in planta, we conducted a RNA-sequencing experiment. A. thaliana sterile seeds were inoculated with mycelium, then cultivated for 28 days on a phosphate-deficient agar-based medium. Roots were harvested and crushed, then total RNA was extracted and sequenced. As control conditions, mycelia were grown on the same plant culture medium and fungal RNA was extracted with the same method, after 28 days in culture. With this experiment, we identified a core set of genes - mostly composed of genes encoding carbohydrate active enzymes - which are over-expressed by all six fungi in the roots of A. thaliana. We believe they constitute a toolbox for root colonization and the endophytic lifestyle. Less..."

PRJNA718567	Heterochromatin is a quantitative trait locus associated with spontaneous epiallele formation (thale cress)	"Epialleles are meiotically inherited variations in expression states that are not linked to changes in DNA sequence. Although they are well documented to persist in plant genomes, their molecular origins are unknown. Here, we show using a variety of mutant and experimental populations that epialleles in Arabidopsis thaliana result from feedback regulation of pathways that primarily function to maintain DNA methylation at heterochromatin. Perturbations to maintenance of heterochromatin methylation leads to feedback regulation of DNA methylation in genes, with a preference for genes with pre-existing DNA methylation. Using epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRIL), we show that epiallelic variation is enriched in euchromatin, yet, associated with QTL primarily located in heterochromatin. Mapping three-dimensional chromatin contacts reveals that genes that are hotspots for epiallelic variation have increased contact frequencies with regions possessing H3K9me2. Altogether, these data show that feedback regulation of pathways that evolved to maintain heterochromatin silencing leads to the origins of spontaneous epialleles.

PRJNA718622	Repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 Prevents Epigenetic Collateral Damage in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"DNA methylation has evolved to silence mutagenic transposable elements (TEs) while typically avoiding the targeting of endogenous genes. Mechanisms that prevent DNA methyltransferases from ectopically methylating genes are expected to be of prime importance during periods of dynamic cell cycle activities including plant embryogenesis. However, virtually nothing is known regarding how DNA methyltransferase activities are precisely regulated during embryogenesis to prevent the induction of potentially deleterious and mitotically stable genic epimutations. Here, we report that microRNA-mediated repression of CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 (CMT3) and the chromatin features that CMT3 prefers help prevent ectopic methylation of thousands of genes during embryogenesis that can persist for weeks afterwards. Moreover, CMT3-induced ectopic methylation of genes undergoing transcriptional activation can reduce their corresponding transcript levels. Therefore, the repression of CMT3 prevents epigenetic collateral damage on endogenous genes. We also provide a model that may help reconcile conflicting viewpoints regarding the functions of gene-body methylation that occurs in nearly all flowering plants.

PRJNA721214	The effect of SEAP1 on the accumulation of miRNAs and mRNAs (thale cress)	"SE-Associated Protein 1 (SEAP1), is a conserved protein in eukaryotes. Its orthologs, SART3 and PRP24 from metazoans and yeast play essential roles in splicing. Here, we report that SE-Associated Protein 1 (SEAP1), is required for miRNA biogenesis in Aradopsis. Lack of SEAP1 causes embryo lethality and knockdown of SEAP1 by an artificial miRNA (amiRSEAP1) causes pleiotropic growth defects and reduction in miRNA accumulation, accompanied with increased levels of target transcripts. SEAP1 associates with the RNase III enzyme Dicer-like 1(DCL1) complex, which processes primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) into miRNAs, and seems to promote the interaction of the DCL1 complexes with pri-miRNAs. SEAP1 is also required for pri-miRNA accumulation. However, it does not affect the transcription of pri-miRNAs, suggesting it may indirectly or directly stabilize pri-miRNAs. SEAP1 also affects the spicing of pri-mRNAs. These results suggest that SEPA1 promotes miRNA biogenesis by positively modulating pri-miRNA splicing, processing and stability. We also find that intron retention in amiRSEAP1 is altered at global levels, linking SEAP1 to spicing. Collectively, our results uncover the function of SEAP1 in plants.

Given the broad-scale use of PEI-functionalized nanomaterials in plants, we sought to investigate the reaction of plant tissues to treatment with PEI-SWNTs and pristine SWNTs. To this end, we infiltrated Arabidopsis thaliana leaves with pristine single walled carbon nanotubes used in RNA silencing applications (SWNTs) and polyethyleneimine-functionalized SWNTs used for plasmid DNA delivery (PEI-SWNTs). We used Arabidopsis as it is a well characterized model plant, for which genomic and detailed gene function information is readily available. To minimize the effects caused by the introduction of exogenous nucleic acids, in SWNT preparations we used single stranded RNA targeting Green Fluorescent Protein (GFP) with no target sequence in the Arabidopsis genome, and a plasmid that expresses GFP in PEI-SWNT preparations. For our experiments herein, we used ~25-50 fold higher concentrations of SWNTs and PEI-SWNTs compared to standard concentrations used in biomolecule delivery assays. Water-infiltrated plant leaves served as a negative control to distinguish between the SWNT-specific response and the response to the infiltration process itself. We performed RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) with RNA extracted from leaves two days after infiltration to identify changes in the leaf transcriptomic profile in response to the three treatments, compared to non-infiltrated leaves.

PRJNA722928	Agrobacterium VirE2 Protein Modulates Plant Gene Expression and Mediates Transformation from Its Location in the Cytoplasm (thale cress)	"Agrobacterium effector protein VirE2 is important for plant transformation. VirE2 likely coats transferred DNA (T-DNA) in the plant cell and protects it from degradation. VirE2 localizes to the plant cytoplasm and interacts with several host proteins. Plant-expressed VirE2 can complement a virE2 mutant Agrobacterium strain to support transformation. We investigated whether VirE2 could facilitate transformation from a nuclear location by affixing to it a strong nuclear localization signal (NLS) sequence. Only cytoplasmic-, but not nuclear-localized, VirE2 could stimulate transformation. To investigate the ways VirE2 supports transformation, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis plants containing a virE2 gene under the control of an inducible promoter and performed RNA-seq and proteomic analyses before and after induction. Some differentially expressed plant genes were previously known to facilitate transformation. Knockout mutant lines of some other VirE2 differentially expressed genes showed altered transformation phenotypes. Levels of some proteins known to be important for transformation increased in response to VirE2 induction, but prior to or without induction of their corresponding mRNAs. Overexpression of some other genes whose proteins increased after VirE2 induction resulted in increased transformation susceptibility. We conclude that cytoplasmically-localized VirE2 modulates both plant RNA and protein levels to facilitate transformation.

Auxin-driven transcriptional responses are mediated through the AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family of transcription factors. Although ARF protein stability is regulated via the 26S proteasome, molecular mechanisms underlying ARF stability and turnover are unknown. Here, we report the identification and functional characterization of an F-Box E3 ubiquitin ligase, which we have named AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR F-BOX1 (AFF1). AFF1 directly interacts with ARF19 and regulates its accumulation. Mutants defective in AFF1 display ARF19 protein hyperaccumulation, mild auxin resistance, and developmental defects. Together, our data suggest a new mechanism, namely control of ARF protein stability, in regulating auxin responsiveness.

Little is known about whether and how the assembly of root microbiota may be controlled by epigenetic regulation, which is crucial for gene transcription and genome stability. Here we show that dysfunction of the histone demethylase IBM1 (INCREASE IN BONSAI METHYLATION 1) in Arabidopsis thaliana substantially reshaped the root microbiota, with the majority of the significant amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) being decreased. Transcriptome analyses of plants grown in soil and in sterile growth-medium jointly disclosed salicylic acid (SA)-mediated autoimmunity and production of the defense metabolite camalexin in the ibm1 mutants. Analyses of genome-wide histone modifications and DNA methylation highlighted epigenetic modifications permissive for transcription at several important defense regulators. Consistently, ibm1 mutants showed increased resistance to the pathogen Pseudomonas syringae DC3000 with stronger immune responses. In addition, ibm1 showed substantially impaired plant growth-promotion in response to beneficial bacteria; the impairment was partially mimicked by exogenous application of SA to wild type plants, and by a null mutation of AGP19 that is important for cell expansion and that is repressed with DNA hyper methylation in ibm1. IBM1-dependent epigenetic regulation imposes strong and broad impacts on plant-microbe interactions and thereby shapes the assembly of root microbiota.

J-domain proteins often serve as co-chaperones with HSP70s. Indeed, we found that SILENZIO?s conserved J-domain motif was required for its interaction with HSP70s and for its silencing function. These results uncover an unprecedented role of a molecular chaperone J-domain protein in gene silencing downstream of DNA methylation.
Overall design: This study includes 11 DAP-seq samples, 19 ChIP-seq samples, 5 BS-seq samples, 18 BS-PCR samples, 82 RNA-seq samples, 2 GRO-seq samples and 1 EM-seq.

PRJNA727190	Interplay between gene expression, histone modifications, and DNA methylation mediated by miR778 during beet cyst nematode parasitism of Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Purpose: The aim of this study is to investigate the role of H3K9 methylation in the development of syncytia induced by the beet cyst nematode (BCN, Heterodera schachtii). For this, differential gene expression analysis was performed in root tissues of Col-0 wild-type and suvh5 and suvh6 single mutants under BCN-infected and noninfected conditions.
Methods: Col-0 wild-type and suvh5 and suvh6 mutant plants were grown and 10-day-old plants were inoculated with 100 second-stage juvenile (J2) H. schachtii at 10 days old. Five days post inoculation, root tissues were collected from infected and noninfected plants in triplicate. Total RNA was extracted, mRNA libraries were prepared, and then high throughput RNA sequencing was performed using the Illumina NovoSeq 6000. High quality, paired-end reads were then aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana reference genome (TAIR10.28) using STAR and uniquely mapped reads were counted using HTSeq. Finally, differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between the mutant lines and wild-type plants under non-infected and infected conditions were identified using DESeq package.
Results and conclusions: At least 20 million reads were uniquely mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome with an average length of about 300 bp for paired-end reads. A total of 1057 and 3390 DEGs were identified for suvh5 and suvh6 versus Col-0, respectively, under noninfected conditions. Upon infection of BCN, Col-0 had 4566 DEGs compared to the noninfected wild type. BCN-infected single mutants suvh5 and suvh6 had 2487 and 846 DEGs compared to BCN-infected Col-0, respectively. Of these DEGs, 1277 and 592 or about 51% and 70% are also differentially expressed in BCN-infected Col compared to noninfected Col-0, respectively, and 324 of the 1277 and 592 DEGs are common to BCN-infected suvh5 and suvh6 compared to the control. DEGs common to BCN-infected Col-0 and/or suvh5, and suvh6 are involved in stress and defense responses, primary and secondary metabolism, signal transduction, cell wall organization and other cellular processes. This suggests that SUVH5 and SUVH6 play a major role in transcriptome reprogramming to facilitate cellular, molecular, and metabolic processes involved in the compatible plant-nematode interaction.

PRJNA727531	The transcriptomic landscape of the photoperiodic stress response in Arabidopsis thaliana resembles the response to pathogen infection (thale cress)	"Plants are exposed to regular diurnal rhythms of light and dark. Changes in the photoperiod by the prolongation of the light period cause photoperiod stress in short day-adapted Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we report on the transcriptional response to photoperiod stress of wild-type A. thaliana and photoperiod stress-sensitive cytokinin signaling and clock mutants. Transcriptomic changes induced by photoperiod stress included numerous changes in reactive oxygen species (ROS)-related transcripts and showed a strong overlap with alterations occurring in response to ozone stress and pathogen attack, which have in common the induction of an apoplastic oxidative burst. A core set of photoperiod stress-responsive genes has been identified, including salicylic acid (SA)-biosynthesis and -signaling genes. Genetic analysis revealed a central role for NPR1 in the photoperiod stress response as npr1-1 mutants were stress-insensitive. Photoperiod stress treatment led to a strong increase in camalexin levels which is also observed in response to pathogen infections. Photoperiod stress induced the resistance of Arabidopsis plants to a subsequent infection by Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 indicating priming of the defence response. Together, photoperiod stress causes transcriptional reprogramming resembling plant pathogen defence responses and induces systemic acquired resistance in the absence of a pathogen.
Overall design: 5-weeks-old short day-grown Arabidopsis plants (WT, ahk2 ahk3, cca1 lhy) were exposed to a 24 h-extended light period (32 h light in total). Sampling for RNAseq analysis was done at 0 h, 4 h, 6 h and 12 h after the end of the prolonged light period. Control plants were sampled on the same moment.

PRJNA727585	Precise transcriptional control of cellular quiescence by BRAVO/WOX5 complex in Arabidopsis roots (thale cress)	"Understanding stem cell regulatory circuits is the next challenge in plant biology, as these cells are essential for tissue growth and organ regeneration in response to stress. In the Arabidopsis primary root apex, stem-cell specific transcription factors BRAVO and WOX5 co-localize in the Quiescent Center (QC) cells, where they commonly repress cell division so that these cells can act as a reservoir to replenish surrounding stem cells, yet their molecular connection remains unknown. Genetic and biochemical analysis indicates that BRAVO and WOX5 form a transcription factor complex that modulates gene expression in the QC cells to preserve overall root growth and architecture. Furthermore, by using mathematical modeling we establish that BRAVO uses the WOX5/BRAVO complex to promote WOX5 activity in the stem cells. Our results unveil the importance of transcriptional regulatory circuits in plant stem cell development.

PRJNA728376	Transcription Factors HBIs-Mediated ROS Homeostasis Regulates Nitrate Signal Transduction in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Nitrate is both an important nutrient and a critical signaling molecule that regulates plant metabolism, growth, and development. Although several components of the nitrate signaling pathway have been identified, the molecular mechanism of nitrate signaling remains unclear. Here, we showed that the growth-related transcription factors HBI1 and its three closest homologs (HBIs) positively regulate nitrate signaling in plants. HBI1 is rapidly induced by nitrate through NLP6 and NLP7, which are master regulators of nitrate signaling pathway. Mutations in HBIs result in the reduced effects of nitrate on plant growth and approximately 22% nitrate-responsive genes no longer to be regulated by nitrate. HBIs increase the expression levels of a set of antioxidant genes to reduce the accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Nitrate treatment induces the nuclear localization of NLP7, whereas such promoting effects of nitrate are significantly impaired in the hbi-q and cat2cat3 mutants, which accumulate high levels of H2O2. These results demonstrate that HBI-mediated ROS homeostasis regulates nitrate signal transduction through modulating the nucleocytoplasmic shuttling of NLP7. Overall, our findings reveal that nitrate treatment reduces the accumulation of H2O2, and H2O2 inhibits nitrate signaling, thereby forming a feedback regulatory loop to regulate plant growth and development.
Overall design: Wild-type Col-0 seedlings, nlp7-1 and hbi-q mutants growing on medium with 7 mM KNO3 for 7 days were transferred to nitrogen-free medium for 2 days then treated with 10 mM KNO3 for 3 hours. To analyse the effects of H2O2 on nitrate regulated gene expression, Col-0 seedlings growing on medium with 7 mM KNO3 for 7 days were transferred to nitrogen-free medium for 2 days then treated with 10 mM KNO3 with or without 0.5 mM H2O2 for 3 hours or treated with H2O2 for 3 hours. Total RNA was extracted with Trizaol RNA extraction kit (Transgene), and mRNA sequencing libraries construction and sequencing on the BGISEQ-500 platform were performed at Beijing Genomics Institute. The sequence reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis genome using HISAT and Bowtie2 software.

To test this hypothesis, we did a transcriptome analysis in of 5d-old long-day (LD)-grown Col-0 (wild type, WT), pif457, and yuc2589 seedlings treated for 3 hours with LB, LRFR or remaining in the same light condition (WL).

PRJNA732230	Naa50 regulates tapetum degradation (thale cress)	"N-terminal acetylation of proteins is a key modification in eukaryotes; however, our understanding of its biological function in plants is limited. Naa50 is the catalytic subunit of the protein N-terminal acetyltransferase NatE complex. We previously showed that the absence of Naa50 led to sterility in Arabidopsis thaliana. In the present study, we show that a lack of Naa50 in Arabidopsis resulted in collapsed and sterile pollen grains. Further study revealed that the mutation of Naa50 accelerated programmed cell death in the tapetum. Expression pattern analysis showed that Naa50 was specifically expressed in tapetal cells from anthers at stages 9–11 of pollen development, when tapetal programmed cell death occurs. Reciprocal cross analyses indicated that the male sterility of naa50 plants was due to sporophytic effects. Transcriptome sequencing of closed buds showed that the deletion of Naa50 resulted in up-regulation of the cysteine protease-coding gene CEP1 and impaired the expression of several genes that function in pollen wall deposition and pollen mitosis. Our findings suggest that Naa50 regulates cell degradation in the tapetum during anther development and plays an important role in pollen development by affecting several pathways.

PRJNA734575	Catabolism of strigolactones by a carboxylesterase (thale cress)	"Strigolactones (SLs) are carotenoid-derived plant hormones that control shoot branching and communications between host plants and symbiotic fungi or root parasitic plants. Extensive studies have identified the key components participating in SL biosynthesis and signaling, whereas the catabolism or deactivation of endogenous SLs in planta remains largely unknown. Here we report that the Arabidopsis carboxylesterase 15 (AtCXE15) and its orthologues function as efficient hydrolases of SLs. We show that overexpression of AtCXE15 promotes shoot branching by dampening SL-inhibited axillary bud outgrowth. We further demonstrate that AtCXE15 could bind and efficiently hydrolyze SLs both in vitro and in planta. We also provide evidence that AtCXE15 is capable to catalyze hydrolysis of diverse SL analogues and that such CXE15-dependent catabolism of SLs is evolutionarily conserved in seed plants. These results disclose a catalytic mechanism underlying homeostatic regulation of SLs in plants, which also provides a rational approach to spatial-temporally manipulate the endogenous SLs and thus architecture of crops and ornamental plants.

PRJNA735204	Gene expression during hormone-induced shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana explants exposed to different temperatures (thale cress)	"Many plants are able to regenerate upon cutting, and this process can be enhanced in vitro by incubating explants on hormone-supplemented media. While such protocols have been used for decades, little is known about the molecular details of how incubation conditions influence their efficiency. In this study, we show that warm temperature promotes both callus formation and shoot regeneration efficiency in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our RNA sequencing analysis unveil that this   accompanied by the enhanced expression of several regeneration-associated genes, such as CUP-SHAPED COTYLEDON 1 (CUC1), encoding a transcription factor involved in shoot meristem formation, and ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE (IPT1) and YUCCA1/4 (YUC1/4), encoding key enzymes for cytokinin and auxin biosynthesis, respectively. Consistently, mutations in CUC1 and IPT1 or chemical inhibition of YUCs reduce the enhancement of shoot regeneration at warm temperature. When combined with ChIP sequencing analyses, our RNA sequencing data further reveal that histone variant H2A.Z is enriched on these differentially expressed loci at 17°C and that its occupancy level decreases when the ambient temperature increases to 27°C. This study thus unveil a new epigenetic mechanism that influences hormone-induced regeneration and brings further insights on how incubation temperature is a crucial parameter in optimizing protocols for in vitro tissue culture.

PRJNA735758	A genetics screen uncovers the role of RNA-binding protein RBP45D in flowering time under heat and DCL3-independent RNA-directed DNA methylation (thale cress)	"In the canonical RdDM, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced through the slicer activity of DICER-LIKE 3 (DCL3). Here, we describe the Arabidopsis thaliana prors1 (LUC) transgenic system in which transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) through RdDM is independent of DLC3. To identify players in the DCL3-independent pathway, a forward genetics screen was performed with the prors1 (LUC) system to identify suppressor mutants in which TGS is released. Among already known components of RdDM, we identified RNA-binding protein RBP45D. RBP45D promotes DNA methylation changes, and a lack of RBP45D results in a late flowering phenotype especially under heat, presumably mediated by elevated FLC levels. A lack of RBP45D did not influence the pre-mRNA splicing of known RdDM genes, suggesting that RBP45D involvement in the RdDM might be direct. RBP45D is localized to the nucleus where it is associated with snRNAs and snoRNAs. RBP45D promotes siRNA production originating from the transgene and we hypothesize that this function is direct and not indirect.

PRJNA737797	RECEPTOR LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 constrains proximal secondary vein branching in the Arabidopsis thaliana embryo (thale cress)	"Over time, plants have evolved flexible self-organizing patterning mechanisms to adapt tissue functionality to continuous organ growth. A clear example of this process is the multicellular organization of vascular cells into narrow and elongated conductive channels in foliar organs of Arabidopsis thaliana such as cotyledons. The establishment of a closed vascular network is achieved through the coordinated specification of newly recruited procambial cells by means of their proliferation and elongation. An important and yet poorly understood component of this process is secondary vein branching; a mechanism employed to extend vascular tissues throughout cotyledon surface. Here we revise the directionality of the formation of vascular tissues in the embryonic cotyledon of Arabidopsis and show that distal veins arise from the bifurcation of cell files contained in the midvein. Instead, proximal veins emerge from the division of provascular cells, a process partially constrained by RECEPTOR LIKE PROTEIN KINASE 2 (RPK2). Utilizing genetic, transcriptomic and live-cell imaging analyses, we show that RPK2 function is antagonized by COTYLEDON VASCULAR PATTERN 2 and its homologous CVP2 LIKE 1. Whilst RPK2 expression at the cotyledon margin prevents the branching of secondary proximal veins, the divergence of the midvein into distal veins appears to be auxin-dependent and follows a distinct regulatory mechanism. Our work supports a model in which RPK2 modulates vascular complexity independently of cell-to-cell auxin-propagation to adapt the spatial configuration of vascular tissues to organ growth.

PRJNA738168	Light regulates xylem cell differentiation via PIF in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Water transport is required for photosynthesis; thus plant vascular development must proceed such that water demands can be met during formation of new organs. Precise regulation of the balance between cell proliferation and differentiation in the cambial meristem defines formation of xylem and phloem, which constitute the vascular tissues. The TDIF-PXY/TDR signalling pathway is central to this process1. Peptide ligand, TDIF, encoded by CLE41 and CLE44 2, activates PXY/TDR receptors to maintain proliferative cambium. Cambium cells differentiate to xylem or phloem in the absence of active TDIF-PXY/TDR complexes. Vascular development is stimulated by light. After gemination, light induces the establishment of photoautotrophic growth via photosynthesis. Consequently, the differentiation of vascular cells must occur to favour the transport of water and minerals from the soil to the green tissues and newly developing organs. Plants perceive light through the action of photoreceptors, which modulate the activity of the transcription factors that orchestrate development. Despite the association between light signalling and vascular development, molecular mechanisms linking the two are unknown. Our work shows that vascular differentiation is inhibited in the dark by a mechanism that depends on PIF transcription factors. The dark accumulation of PIFs is necessary for CLE44 induction and thus maintenance of undifferentiated vasculature. In illuminated environments, PIF inactivation by photoreceptors causes a decrease in CLE44 expression. CLE44 reduction, in turn, leads to reduced PXY/TDR signalling which induces the xylem differentiation required to fulfil the water demands associated with photoautotrophic development.
Overall design: Arabidopsis seedlings were grown in the dark for 5 days, then exposed to white light for varying lengths of time (15, 30, 60, 150, and 360 min) before tissue collection.

PRJNA738538	RNA-seq analysis of callus of Arabidopsis WT and plt1 plt2 (thale cress)	"In plant tissue culture, callus forms from detached explants in response to a high-auxin-to-low-cytokinin ratio on callus-inducing medium. Callus is a group of pluripotent cells because it can regenerate either roots or shoots in response to a low level of auxin on root-inducing medium or a high-cytokinin-to-low-auxin ratio on shoot-inducing medium, respectively1. However, our knowledge of the mechanism of pluripotency acquisition during callus formation is limited. On the basis of analyses at the single-cell level, we show that the tissue structure of Arabidopsis thaliana callus on callus-inducing medium is similar to that of the root primordium or root apical meristem, and the middle cell layer with quiescent centre-like transcriptional identity exhibits the ability to regenerate organs. In the middle cell layer, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 (WOX5) directly interacts with PLETHORA1 and 2 to promote TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS1 expression for endogenous auxin production. WOX5 also interacts with the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR12 (ARR12) and represses A-type ARRs to break the negative feedback loop in cytokinin signalling. Overall, the promotion of auxin production and the enhancement of cytokinin sensitivity are both required for pluripotency acquisition in the middle cell layer of callus for organ regeneration.

PRJNA739879	Transcriptional activation of auxin biosynthesis drives developmental reprogramming of differentiated cells (thale cress)	"Plant cells exhibit remarkable plasticity of their differentiation states, enabling regeneration of whole plants from differentiated somatic cells. How they revert cell fate and express pluripotency, however, remains unclear. Here we show that transcriptional activation of auxin biosynthesis is crucial for reprogramming differentiated leaf cells in Arabidopsis. We demonstrate that intervention of histone acetyltransferases causes severe defects in callus formation from leaf mesophyll protoplasts. Our data suggest that histone acetylation affects transcription of auxin biosynthesis genes. Auxin biosynthesis is in turn required to accomplish initial cell division through the activation of G2/M phase genes mediated by MYB DOMAIN PROTEIN 3-RELATED (MYB3Rs). We further show that AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR 7 (ARF7)/ARF19 and INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 3 (IAA3)/IAA18-mediated auxin signaling pathway is responsible for the cell cycle reactivation in protoplasts. These findings provide novel mechanistic insights into how differentiated plant cells revert their fate and reinitiate the cell cycle to exert pluripotency.

PRJNA743058	Cell-wall damage activates DOF transcription factors to promote wound healing and tissue regeneration in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Wound healing is a fundamental property of plants and animals that requires recognition of cellular damage to initiate regeneration. In plants, wounding activates a defense response via the production of jasmonic acid and a regeneration response via the hormone auxin and several ethylene response factor (ERF) and NAC domain-containing protein (ANAC) transcription factors. To better understand how plants recognize damage and initiate healing, we searched for factors upregulated during the horticulturally relevant process of plant grafting and found four related DNA binding with one finger (DOF) transcription factors, HIGH CAMBIAL ACTIVITY2 (HCA2), TARGET OF MONOPTEROS6 (TMO6), DOF2.1, and DOF6, whose expression rapidly activated at the Arabidopsis graft junction. Grafting or wounding a quadruple hca2, tmo6, dof2.1, dof6 mutant inhibited vascular and cell-wall-related gene expression. Furthermore, the quadruple dof mutant reduced callus formation, tissue attachment, vascular regeneration, and pectin methylesterification in response to wounding. We also found that activation of DOF gene expression after wounding required auxin, but hormone treatment alone was insufficient for their induction. However, modifying cell walls by enzymatic digestion of cellulose or pectin greatly enhanced TMO6 and HCA2 expression, whereas genetic modifications to the pectin or cellulose matrix using the PECTIN METHYLESTERASE INHIBITOR5 overexpression line or korrigan1 mutant altered TMO6 and HCA2 expression. Changes to the cellulose or pectin matrix were also sufficient to activate the wound-associated ERF115 and ANAC096 transcription factors, suggesting that cell-wall damage represents a common mechanism for wound perception and the promotion of tissue regeneration.

However, most of NGS-based Y2H screening methods are suitable for well-constructed ORFeomes but not cDNA libraries. Thus, we developed a novel NGS-based Y2H screening method to accomplish a precise Y2H screening with cDNA libraries. With newly designed primers, we can distinguish and filter out those non-in-frame reads from all mapped reads, which facilitates the estimation of the interaction intensity between baits and preys.
Overall design: The prey inserts were PCR-amplified from selected yeast colonies (>3000 colonies per sample). After fragmentation, the DNA fragment of prey inserts were ligated to standard Illumina adaptor. Then, the second round PCR amplification was performed to enrich the DNA fragments with 29 bp vector sequence and simultaneously the standard Illumina DNA library for paired-end sequencing was obtained.

PRJNA744409	MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade regulates Agrobacterium-mediated transformation by modulating plant immunity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is a special plant pathogen causing crown gall disease. This pathogen is well known for the technology Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. As a pathogen, Agrobacterium triggers plant immunity, and this affects transformation. But the signaling components and pathways in plant immunity to Agrobacterium remain elusive.     We demonstrate two Arabidopsis MAPKKs MKK4/MKK5 and their downstream MAPKs MPK3/MPK6 play a major role in both Agrobacterium-triggered immunity and Agrobacterium-mediated transformation. Agrobacteria induce MPK3/MPK6 activity and plant defense responsive genes expression in a very early stage. This process is dependent on MKK4/MKK5 function.     Loss of function of MKK4 and MKK5 or their downstream MPK3 and MPK6 abolishes plant immunity to agrobacteria, and increases the transformation frequency, while activation of MKK4 and MKK5 enhances the plant immunity and represses the transformation. Global transcriptome indicates agrobacteria induce various plant defense pathways, including ROS production, ethylene and SA-mediated defense responses, and MKK4/MKK5 is essential for these pathways induction. Activation of MKK4 and MKK5 promotes ROS production and cell death in agrobacteria infection process. Ethylene and SA act bypass of MKK4/MKK5 signaling to regulate transformation.    Based on these results, we propose MKK4/5-MPK3/6 cascade is an essential signaling pathway to regulate Agrobacterium-mediated transformation by modulating Agrobacterium-triggered plant immunity.

PRJNA744559	Chemically-induced epimutagenesis allows bypassing reproductive barriers in hybrid seeds [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The ""triploid block"" prevents interploidy hybridizations in flowering plants, and is characterized by failure in endosperm development and function, arrest in embryogenesis, and seed collapse. Many genetic components of triploid seed lethality have been successfully identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, most notably the paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) that are up-regulated in the tetraploid endosperm with paternal excess. Previous studies have shown that the paternal epigenome is a key determinant of the triploid block response, as the loss of DNA methylation in diploid pollen suppresses the triploid block almost completely. Here, we demonstrate that triploid seed abortion is bypassed in plants treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor 5-Azacytidine during seed germination and early plant growth. We have identified strong suppressor lines showing transgenerational inheritance of hypomethylation in CG context, as well as normalized expression of PEGs. Importantly, differentially methylated loci segregate in the progeny of ""epimutagenized"" plants, which may allow the identification of epialleles involved in the triploid block response in future studies. Finally, we demonstrate that chemically-induced epimutagenesis allows bypassing interploidy hybridizations in Arabidopsis and interspecific hybridization barriers in crosses between Capsella species, thus potentially emerging as a novel strategy for seed-based breeding of triploids and interspecific hybrids with agronomical interest.

PRJNA745095	Histone H1 prevents non-CG methylation-mediated small RNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis heterochromatin (thale cress)	"Functional genomic states are maintained by reinforcing chromatin interactions that exclude the components of other states. Plant heterochromatin features methylation of histone H3 at lysine 9 (H3K9me) and extensive DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation is also catalyzed by a mostly euchromatic small RNA-directed pathway (RdDM) thought to seek H3K9me. How RdDM is excluded from H3K9me-rich heterochromatin is unclear. Here we show that without histone H1, RdDM enters heterochromatin, preferentially at nucleosome linker DNA. Surprisingly, this does not require SHH1, the RdDM component that binds H3K9me. Furthermore, H3K9me is dispensable for RdDM, as is CG DNA methylation. Instead, we find that non-CG methylation is specifically required for small RNA biogenesis, and without H1 small RNA production quantitatively expands to non-CG methylated loci. Our results demonstrate that H1 enforces the separation of euchromatic and heterochromatic DNA methylation pathways by excluding the small RNA-generating branch of RdDM from non-CG methylated heterochromatin.
Overall design: Bisulfite and RNA sequencing was performed using h1cmt2, h1cmt2shh1, h1cmt2cmt3 plants (1-2 replicates) to examine the effect of H1, non-CG DNA methylation and SHH1 on RNA-directed DNA methylation activity. sRNA-seq was performed using wt, h1, ddm1, h1ddm1, cmt2cmt3, h1cmt2cmt3, met1, and h1met1 plants (3 replicates, except for met1 and h1met1) to examine the effect of H1, non-CG DNA methylation on 24 nt sRNA expression.

PRJNA745175	Non-cell autonomous and spatiotemporal signaling from a tissue organizer orchestrates root vascular development (thale cress)	"During plant development, a precise balance of cytokinin is crucial for correct growth and patterning, but it remains unclear how this is achieved across different cell types and in the context of a growing organ. Here we show that in the root apical meristem, the TMO5/LHW complex increases active cytokinin levels via two cooperatively acting enzymes. By profiling the transcriptomic changes of increased cytokinin at single-cell level, we further show that this effect is counteracted by a tissue-specific increase in CYTOKININ OXIDASE 3 expression via direct activation of the mobile transcription factor SHORTROOT. In summary, we show that within the root meristem, xylem cells act as a local organizer of vascular development by non-autonomously regulating cytokinin levels in neighbouring procambium cells via sequential induction and repression modules.

PRJNA745576	Auxin requirements for a meristematic state in roots depend on a dual brassinosteroid function (thale cress)	"Root meristem organization is maintained by an interplay between hormone signaling pathways that both interpret and determine their accumulation and distribution. The interacting hormones Brassinosteroids (BR) and auxin control the number of meristematic cells in the Arabidopsis root. BR was reported both to promote auxin signaling input and to repress auxin signaling output. Whether these contradicting molecular outcomes co-occur and what their significance in meristem function is remain unclear. Here, we established a dual effect of BR on auxin, with BR simultaneously promoting auxin biosynthesis and repressing auxin transcriptional output, which is essential for meristem maintenance. Blocking BR-induced auxin synthesis resulted in rapid BR-mediated meristem loss. Conversely, plants with reduced BR levels were resistant to a critical loss of auxin biosynthesis, maintaining their meristem morphology. In agreement, injured root meristems, which rely solely on local auxin synthesis, regenerated when both auxin and BR synthesis were inhibited. Use of BIN2 as a tool to selectively inhibit BR signaling yielded meristems with distinct phenotypes depending on the perturbed tissue: meristem reminiscent either of BR-deficient mutants or of high BR exposure. This enabled mapping of the BR-auxin interaction that maintains the meristem to the outer epidermis and lateral root cap tissues and demonstrated the essentiality of BR signaling in these tissues for meristem response to BR. BR activity in internal tissues however, proved necessary to control BR levels. Together, we demonstrate a basis for inter-tissue coordination and how a critical ratio between these hormones determines the meristematic state.

PRJNA746250	Redundancies in low K signaling of neo-tetraploids leads in increased shoot K [RNA-seq_1] (thale cress)	"Whole Genome Duplication (WGD) events occurred frequently during land plant evolution and their long term benefits to neo-functionalization of genes and speciation is well known (Baduel et al., 2018). However short term benefits, important for the establishment of a new population, are more difficult to observe until Chao et al., 2013 described a fitness advantage under high salinity. Additionally shoot K levels were higher in neo-tetraploids, an important feature since K uptake becomes increasingly more difficult on highly saline soil. The molecular basis for these phenotypes was not known. Here we analyze neo-tetraploid Arabidopsis thaliana plants using RNAseq and ICP-MS to evaluate the effect of mutations and ploidy on the gene expression and shoot ionome. We are able to show that neo-tetraploid plants induce low-potassium (K) signaling to increase their shoot K content. However, we also show that this low-K signaling is distinct form previously studied, externally applied low-K signaling. In this way, we are able to identify new components of the K homeostasis network, which are required to regulate K demand. Additionally we are able to show that while individual components of the K uptake system are not sufficient to increase shoot K, a loss of root hairs abolished the ploidy K phenotype (PPP) as does a defective Casparian strip. Root hairs are the site of entry of K into the root and neo-tetraploids increase their root hair length and density (RHI) to facilitate their higher K demand. The Casparian strip on the other hand enables higher K concentration in the stele of the root, which is required for the increased K content in neo-tetraploids.

This light-controlled process relies on the transcription of nuclear and plastid genomes that drives the effective assembly and regulation of the photosynthetic machinery. Here we reveal a novel regulation level for this process by showing the involvement of chromatin remodelling in the coordination of nuclear and plastid gene expression for proper chloroplast biogenesis and function. The two Arabidopsis homologs of the yeast EPL1 proteins, core components of the NuA4 histone acetyl-transferase complex, are essential for the correct assembly and performance of chloroplasts. EPL1 proteins are necessary for the coordinated expression of nuclear genes encoding most of the components of chloroplast transcriptional machinery, specifically promoting H4K5Ac deposition in these loci. These data unveil a key participation of epigenetic regulatory mechanisms in the coordinated expression of the nuclear and plastid genomes.

PRJNA749457	Next Generation Sequencing (m6A-seq) Reveals RNA m6A Methylation Patterns During the floral transition of Arobidopsis (thale cress)	"In this study, we identified METTL16 as an mRNA m6A methyltransferase that plays a vital role in the floral transition in Arabidopsis. Transcriptome-wide analysis of RNA methylome in the mettl16 mutant revealed that m6A modification enriched near the stop codon and within the 3ʹ untranslated region. Deficiency of METTL16 leads to decreases in m6A levels of approximately 471 transcripts, indicating that it is responsible for the methylation of a small group of mRNAs. The mettl16 mutant displayed an early flowering phenotype, and the level of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) was markedly decreased in the mutant. Importantly, METTL16-mediated m6A methylation affects the splicing of FLC, thereby influencing its transcript level to regulate floral transition. Our study identified METTL16 as a novel m6A methyltransferase and suggests a close molecular link between METTL16-mediated m6A methylation and FLC splicing in flowering time control.

NTL proteins are a group of NAC transcription factors, and play an important role in the mechanisms of plant response to various abiotic stresses, such as drought, salt and cold stress. However, the underlying adaption mechanism of whether NTL is involved in regulating Al toxicity in plants remain poorly understood. Soybean is important grain and oil crop. Therefore, this study focused onanalyzing the function of GmNTLs in soybean adaptation to Al toxicity.

The best characterised signal regulating gene expression in response to drought is the phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA). ABA-regulated gene expression, biosynthesis and signalling are highly organised in a diurnal cycle, so that ABA-regulated physiological traits occur at the appropriate time of the day. The mechanisms that underpin such diel oscillations in ABA signals are poorly characterised.  Here we uncover GIGANTEA (GI) as a key gate keeper of ABA-regulated transcriptional  and physiological responses. Time-resolved RNAseq under different irrigation scenarios indicate that gi mutants produce an exaggerated ABA response at midday, despite accumulating wild-type levels ABA. The direct comparison with ABA-deficient mutants confirms the role of GI in controlling ABA-regulated genes and enabled us to distinguish a phase of high ABA sensitivity at dawn, characterized by low GI accumulation.

Here we combined digital 3D single-cell shape analysis and single-cell mRNA sequencing to characterize root meristems and mature root segments of brassinosteroid-blind mutants and wildtype. These data demonstrate that brassinosteroid signaling neither affects cell volume nor cell proliferation capacity. Instead, brassinosteroid signaling is essential for the precise orientation of cell division planes and the extent and timing of anisotropic cell expansion. Moreover, we found that the cell-aligning effects of brassinosteroid signaling can propagate to normalize the anatomy of both adjacent and distant brassinosteroid-blind cells through non-cell-autonomous functions, which are sufficient to restore growth vigor. Finally, single-cell transcriptome data discern directly brassinosteroid-responsive genes from genes that can react non-cell-autonomously and highlight arabinogalactans as sentinels of brassinosteroid-dependent anisotropic cell expansion.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6/JUMONJI DOMAIN-CONTAINING PROTEIN 12 (REF6/JMJ12) demethylates H3K27me3 by recognizing a specific DNA motif; however, little is known about how REF6 activates target gene expression after recognition, especially in environmental responses. In response to warm ambient temperature, plants undergo thermomorphogenesis, which involves accelerated growth, early flowering, and changes in morphology. Here we show that REF6 regulates thermomorphogenesis and cooperates with the transcription factor PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4) to synergistically activate thermo-responsive genes under warm ambient temperature. The ref6 loss-of-function mutants exhibited attenuated hypocotyl elongation at warm temperature, partially due to down-regulation of GIBBERELLIN 20-OXIDASE2 (GA20ox2) and BASIC HELIX-LOOP-HELIX 87 (bHLH87).

How the MG cell/VC fate is determined remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the VC-targeted H3K27me3 erasure resulted in VC fate transition towards a gamete destination. Multi-omics and cytologic analysis reveal that H3K27me3 is essential for VC fate commitment and contributes to suppress the MG cell fate initiation in VC, whereas MG cells require H3K27me3 reprograming for the gamete cell fate. This work suggests that the MG cell/VC fate is epigenetically regulated. The dimorphic H3K27 methylation acts as a core switch to determine their distinct cell fates and ensure the functional specification of both VC and MG for pollen fertility. This work also provides direct evidences for the proposal that VC maintains the default developmental program of microspore, whereas MG requires reprogramming.

PRJNA752148	The DREAM complex antagonizes WDR5a and represses the productive elongation of transcription in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The master transcriptional repressor DREAM (dimerization partner, RB-like, E2F and multi-vulval class B) complex regulates cell cycle in eukaryotes, but much remains unknown about how it transmits repressive signals on chromatin to the primary transcriptional machinery (e.g., Pol II). Through a genetic screen, we identified BTE1 (barrier of transcription elongation 1), a key component in the plant DREAM complex. The subsequent characterization demonstrated that the DREAM complex represses Pol II elongation. The core DREAM subunits E2F transcription factors recruit BTE1 to accumulate at the promoter-proximal regions of target genes. DREAM target genes exhibit characteristic enrichment of H2A.Z and H3K4me2 modification on chromatin. The DREAM complex BTE1 subunit interacts with WDR5a, repressing WDR5a chromatin binding and the productive elongation of transcription on BTE1-targeted genomic loci. Thus, we demonstrate a major role of DREAM complex in the control of transition from transcription initiation to productive elongation around TSSs on the open chromatin via inhibiting WDR5a function.

PRJNA752376	Analyses of translatome combined with transcriptome in Arabidopsis shoot and root reveals new players responding to magnesium deficiency. (thale cress)	"Translational control of gene expression, including recruitment of ribosome to mRNA, is particularly important for stress responses. Translating Ribosome Affinity Purification (TRAP)-based RNA-sequencing offers a tool to study ribosome-associated mRNAs, which better proxies protein levels via the levels of transcripts to be translated into proteins. Magnesium (Mg) greatly inhibits plant growth and affects crop productivity. To identify new players for better understanding plants in response to Mg deficiency at the translational level, we combined the transcriptome with translatome analyses. We revealed that 26 previously unreported Mg responsive genes, which were only regulated at the translational level, not transcriptional level at an early stage upon Mg deficiency. Among six mutants analyzed, we found that mutants of the transcriptional factor of ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5), H+/cation exchanger 1 and 3 and UBIQUITIN 14 exhibited early chlorosis phenotype under Mg deficiency. UBIQUITIN 14 is the first UBIQUITIN protein reported to be functionally involved in ion homeostasis. Overall, our study demonstrates that there is a strong correlation between ribosome-associated mRNA abundance and mutant phenotypes, strongly supporting that TRAP-seq combined with RNA-seq followed by phenotype screening could serve as a valuable tool to identify novel players during stress responses.

PRJNA752623	Genome-wide identification of RNA-chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis [GRO-seq] (thale cress)	"It is increasingly evident that various RNA molecules can bind chromatin to regulate gene expression and genome organization. Here we adapted a sequencing-based technique to profile RNA-chromatin interactions at a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis seedlings. We identified more than ten thousand RNA-chromatin interactions mediated by protein-coding RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and small ncRNAs in Arabidopsis. These RNAs preferentially target genic regions, especially exonic regions. Protein-coding RNAs primarily engage in local and cis-chromosomal interactions, whereas long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and small ncRNAs preferentially engage in trans-chromosomal interactions. RNA-chromatin interactions tend to positively correlate with DNA-DNA interactions, suggesting a role of DNA-DNA interactions in confining RNA-chromatin interactions and/or a role of RNA-chromatin interactions in shaping genome organization at a global level. We further show that some RNA-chromatin interactions undergo alterations in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our study provides a global view of RNA-chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis and a rich resource for future investigation of the regulatory roles of RNAs in gene expression and genome organization.
Overall design: To identify chromatin-associated RNAs and their target sites in Arabidopsis, we conducted GRID-seq using Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 seedlings. To evaluate the contribution of RNA transcription level to the abundance of RNAs detected in GRID-seq, we conducted global nuclear run-on sequencing (Gro-seq) to detect the levels of nascent RNAs and compared RNA reads in GRID-seq and Gro-seq. To determine the overlap between RNA-chromatin interactions and DNA-DNA interactions, we conducted BL-Hi-C and compared interactions identified by GRID-seq and BL-Hi-C. To determine whether RNA-chromatin interactions are dynamic and respond to environmental cues, we conducted GRID-seq using heat-treated and DC3000-treated seedlings. Less..."

PRJNA699408	Light-dependent translation change of Arabidopsis chloroplast genes and mRNA structure alterations	mRNA secondary structure influences translation. Proteins that modulate the mRNA secondary structure around the translation initiation region may regulate translation in plastids. To test this hypothesis, we exposed Arabidopsis thaliana to high light, which induces translation of psbA mRNA encoding the D1 subunit of photosystem II. We assayed translation by ribosome profiling and applied two complementary methods to analyze in vivo RNA secondary structure: DMS-MaPseq and SHAPE-seq. We detected increased accessibility of the translation initiation region of psbA after high light treatment, likely contributing to the observed increase in translation by facilitating translation initiation. This supports the idea that changes in mRNA secondary structure might represent a general mechanism for translational regulation of psbA and other plastid genes. Less...

PRJDB8075	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNAsequencing analysis for ANAC032-VP32 overexpressor	Reactive oxygen species (ROS) play important roles as root growth regulators. We previously reported a comprehensive transcriptomic atlas, which we named ROS-map, that revealed ROS-responsible genes in Arabidopsis root tips. We characterised the function of another early ROS-responsible transcription factor, ANAC032, that was selected from ROS-map. Overexpression of ANAC032 fused with the transcriptional activation domain, VP32, inhibited root growth, especially decreasing cell elongation. To investigate ANAC032 regulation of gene expressions, we conducted an RNAseq analysis by using the ANAC032-VP32 OX line. By transcriptome analysis, we revealed that ANAC032 regulated many stress-responsible genes in the roots. Intriguingly, ANAC032 upregulated MYB30 and its target genes. Overall, we characterised an upstream transcription factor, ANAC032, of the MYB30 transcriptional cascade which is a key regulator for root cell elongation under ROS signalling. Less...	
PRJDB5652	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The number of phosphorylated SOG1 sites regulates DNA damage response in A. thaliana	The A. thaliana transcription factor SOG1 regulates hundreds of genes in response to DNA damage, which results in the activation of cell-cycle arrest, DNA repair, endoreduplication, and programmed cell death. However, each pathway leads the cell to a different fate: cell-cycle arrest and DNA repair result in cell survival, endoreduplication leads to cell differentiation, and programmed cell death results in cell elimination. How this single transcription factor regulates each pathway is unknown. We previously reported that phosphorylation of five serine-glutamine (SQ) motifs in the C-terminal of SOG1 are required to activate downstream pathways. In this study, we introduced mutations in these five SQ motifs and examined the effects on DNA damage responses. We found that the expression level of most of genes gradually changed dependent on the number of SOG1 phosphorylation sites. Genes involved in DNA repair and cell-cycle progression undergo stepwise activation and inhibition, respectively, as the number of phosphorylated SQ sites increases. Furthermore, we showed that programmed cell death and cell differentiation are induced by fewer SOG1 phosphorylation sites than that needed for replication arrest. These results show that the number of SQ phosphorylation in SOG1 regulates gene expression and determines pathway activation in response to DNA damage. Less...

PRJDB8627	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide expression analysis regulated by internal nitrate in the presence of external ammonium in Arabidopsis thaliana	The effects of internal nitrate level on transcriptome in Arabidopsis thaliana were analyzed. To manipulate internal nitrate levels independently of internal organic nitrogen, wild-type accession Col and a nitrate reductase (NR)-null mutant were used. Col and the NR-null mutant were grown for 7 days using 2.5 mM ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. The plants were treated with 10 mM nitrate and 2.5 mM ammonium for the first 24 hours so that they would accumulate nitrate. The plants were then transferred to 0.2 mM ammonium-containing medium and grown for 5 days.

PRJDB8628	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Cytokinin regulation by CRABS CLAW and SUPERMAN during Arabidopsis stamen formation	Termination of floral meristem activity (FM determinacy) at right timing is crucial to define floral organ numbers. Two transcription factors, CRABS CRAW (CRC) and SUPERMAN (SUP) play key roles in FM determinacy. CRC belongs to the YABBY family transcription factors, which contain a zinc finger and a helix-loop-helix domain. The crc mutation causes the formation of unfused carpels. In sensitized backgrounds, it leads to the increase in carpel numbers. On the other hand, SUP encodes a C2H2-type zinc finger protein. The sup mutants produce extra carpels and stamens. However, the genetic interaction between CRC and SUP has not been not fully understood. To understand genes controlled by these two factors, RNA-seq was performed. Less...

PRJDB9689	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)microRNA-mediated ribosome stalling promotes secondary siRNA biogenesis in plants	Ribosome traverse on mRNAs is not always smooth but can be impeded by various obstacles. One such example is halting of ribosome movements by microRNAs in plants. However, its exact mechanism and physiological role remain unclear. Here, by combining genome-wide ribosome profiling, in vitro biochemical analyses, and in planta assays, we found a direct link between microRNA-mediated ribosome stalling and amplification of RNA silencing. To stall ribosomes, the microRNA within Argonaute protein needs to directly interact with the double-stranded RNA-binding protein SGS3. Strikingly, ribosome stalling by microRNAs elicits the production of secondary small interfering RNAs from target mRNAs. Our results uncover a previously uncharacterized role for paused ribosomes.

PRJDB10113	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Chromatin-based mechanisms to coordinate convergent overlapping transcription	In eukaryotic genomes, transcription units of genes often overlap with other protein-coding and/or noncoding transcription units. In such intertwined genomes, coordinated transcription of nearby or overlapping genes would be important to ensure integrity of genome function; however, the mechanisms underlying this coordination are largely unknown. Here, we show in Arabidopsis thaliana that genes with convergent orientation of transcription are major sources of overlapping bidirectional transcripts and that these bidirectionally transcribed genes are regulated by a putative LSD1 family histone demethylase, FLD. Our genome-wide chromatin profiling revealed that FLD, as well as its candidate cofactors LD and SDG26, downregulated histone H3K4me1 in regions with convergent overlapping transcription. FLD localizes to actively transcribed genes where it colocalizes with elongating RNA polymerase II phosphorylated at Ser-2 or Ser-5 sites. Genome-wide transcription analyses suggest that FLD-mediated H3K4me1 removal negatively regulates bidirectional transcription by retaining the elongating transcription machinery. Furthermore, this effect of FLD on transcription dynamics is mediated by DNA topoisomerase I. Our study has revealed chromatin-based mechanisms to cope with overlapping bidirectional transcription, which may occur by modulating DNA topology. This global mechanism to cope with bidirectional transcription could be co-opted for specific epigenetic processes, such as cellular memory of responses to environment. Less...

PRJDB11645	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Mechanosensory Trichome Cells Evoke Mechanical Stimuli-induced Immune Response in Plants	Perception of pathogen-derived ligands by their corresponding host receptors is a pivotal strategy in eukaryotic innate immunity. In plants, this is complemented by circadian anticipation of infection timing, thereby promoting basal resistance even in the absence of pathogen threat. Trichomes, which are hair-like structures on the epidermis, directly sense external mechanical forces caused by raindrops to anticipate waterborne infections. Exposure of leaf surfaces to mechanical stimuli such as raindrops initiates the concentric propagation of intercellular calcium waves away from trichomes to induce defense-related genes. We propose a novel layer of plant immunity in which trichomes function as mechanosensory cells to detect potential risks. Less...

PRJEB37132	upf1 ArabidopsisNonsense mediated RNA decay factor UPF1 is critical for posttranscriptional and translational gene regulation in Arabidopsis	Nonsense mediated RNA decay (NMD) is an evolutionary conserved RNA control mechanism that has also been implicated in the broader regulation of gene expression. Nevertheless, a role for NMD in genome regulation has not been fully assessed, partially because NMD inactivation is lethal in many organisms. Here, we performed in depth comparative analysis of Arabidopsis mutants lacking key proteins involved in different steps of NMD. We observed that UPF3, UPF1, and SMG7 have different impacts on NMD and the Arabidopsis transcriptome, with UPF1 having the biggest effect. De novo Ttranscriptome assembly using a stringent pipeline in UPF1-null plants revealed genome wide changes in alternative splicing, including switches in mRNA variants, suggesting a role for UPF1 in splicing. We further found that UPF1 inactivation leads to translational repression, manifested by a global shift in mRNAs from polysomes to monosomes and a downregulation of genes involved in translation and ribosome biogenesis. Despite this global change, NMD targets and low-expressed mRNAs with short half-lives were enriched in polysomes, indicating that UPF1 specifically suppresses the translation of aberrant RNAs. Particularly striking was an increase in the translation of TIR domain-containing, nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat (TNL) immune receptors. The regulation of TNLs via UPF1/NMD-mediated mRNA stability and translational de-repression offers a dynamic mechanism for the rapid activation of TNLs in response to pathogen attack. Less...

PRJEB40488	GNSRA general non-self response as part of plant immunity	Plants, like other multicellular organisms, are colonized by microorganisms. How plants respond to their microbiota is currently not well understood. We used a phylogenetically diverse set of 39 native bacterial strains from Arabidopsis thaliana leaves to assess host transcriptional and metabolic adaptations to bacterial encounters. We identified a molecular response, which we termed the general non-self response (GNSR) that involves the expression of a core set of 24 genes. The GNSR genes are not only consistently induced by the presence of the majority of strains, they also comprise the most differentially regulated genes across treatments and are predictive of a hierarchical transcriptional reprogramming beyond the GNSR. Using a complementary untargeted metabolomics approach we link the GNSR to the tryptophan derived secondary metabolism, highlighting the importance of small molecules in plant microbe interactions. We demonstrate that seven of the GNSR genes, namely CHX16, IGMT3, MLO12, CYP71A12, PRX71, GSTF6 and AT2G43620, are required for resistance against the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Our results suggest that the GNSR constitutes a defense adaptation strategy that is consistently elicited by diverse strains from various phyla, contributes to host protection and involves secondary metabolism.

PRJEB42556	HASTY modulates miRNA biogenesis by linking pri-miRNA transcription and processing	Post-transcriptional gene silencing mediated by microRNAs (miRNAs) modulates numerous developmental and stress response pathways. For the last two decades, HASTY (HST), the ortholog of human EXPORTIN 5, was considered to be a candidate protein that exports plant miRNAs from the nucleus to the cytoplasm. Here, we report that HST functions in the miRNA pathway independent of its cargo-exporting activity in Arabidopsis. We found that Arabidopsis mutants with impaired HST shuttling exhibit normal subcellular distribution of miRNAs. Interestingly, protein-protein interaction and microscopy assays showed that HST directly interacts with the microprocessor core component DCL1 through its N-terminal domain. Moreover, mass spectrometry analysis revealed that HST also interacts independently of its N-terminal domain with the mediator complex subunit MED37. Further experiments revealed that HST could act as a scaffold to facilitate the recruitment of DCL1 to genomic MIRNA loci by stabilizing the DCL1-MED37 complex, which in turn promotes the transcription and proper processing of primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs).  Taken together, these results suggest that HST is likely associated with the formation of the miRNA biogenesis complex at MIRNA genes, promoting the transcription and processing of pri-miRNAs rather than the direct export of processed miRNAs from the nucleus.

PRJEB43717	Transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to exogenous application of N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP).	Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that the resistance increase observed after biological systemic acquired resistance (SAR) induction in plants can be mimicked by exogenous plant treatment with N-hydroxypipecolic acid (NHP, Hartmann et al., 2018, Schnake et al., 2020).  Moreover, exogenous application of the NHP biosynthetic precursor pipecolic acid (Pip) induced a transcriptional response that was overlapping with the SAR transcriptional response and fully depended on the NHP synthase FMO1 (Hartmann et al., 2018; E-MTAB-6243). In order to investigate whether elevations of NHP lead to a SAR-like transcriptional reprogramming, we supplied individual Arabidopsis wildtype Col-0 plants, as well as sid2-1 and npr1-3 mutant plants, with doses of 10 µmol NHP and determined the transcriptional response in leaves 24 hours later on the whole genome level by RNA-sequencing analyses in relation to control-treated (H2O) plants. Col-0 plants were additionally treated with doses of 10 µmol Pip in order to directly compare the transcriptional responses of the foliage between Pip and NHP. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil, vermiculite and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h day (9 AM to 7 PM; photon flux density 100 mol m-2 s-1) / 14-h night cycle and a relative humidity of 70 %. Day and night temperatures were set to 21°C and 18°C, respectively. Experiments were performed with 5-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance. Treatments with NHP and Pip were essentially performed as detailed in Hartmann et al. (2018, Cell 173, 456–469). In brief, 10 ml of a 1 mM aqueous solution of NHP or Pip (equates to a dose of 10 µmol) were pipetted onto the soil of individually cultivated plants. 10 ml of water applied in the way served as control treatments. In total, three biologically independent, replicate experiments were performed. In each experiment, 18 full-grown leaves from 6 different plants were pooled 24 hours after the respective treatments for one biological replicate. In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained. Less...

PRJEB37696	Lj-SPHERE (WGS)Lotus japonicus culture collection (whole-genome and -transcriptome sequences)	Healthy plants are colonized by microorganisms from the surrounding environment, which form stable communities and provide beneficial services to the host. Culture-independent profiling of the bacterial root microbiota shows that different plant species are colonized by distinct bacterial communities that provide beneficial services to the host. It is, however, not known to what extent the host actively selects these communities and whether commensal bacteria are adapted to a specific plant species. Here, we report a sequence-indexed culture collection from roots and nodules of the model legume Lotus japonicus that contains representatives from the majority of species found in culture-independent profiles. Using taxonomically equivalent synthetic communities from L. japonicus and the crucifer Arabidopsis thaliana in a multi-species gnotobiotic system, we detect clear signatures of host preference in commensal bacteria in a community context that are indicative of host adaptation. Furthermore, sequential inoculation of either host with synthetic communities reveals strong priority effects during the assembly of the root microbiota, where established communities are resilient to invasion by late-comers. However, our results indicate that host preference by commensal bacteria confers a competitive advantage in their native host. We reveal that host preference is prevalent in commensal bacteria from diverse taxonomic groups and that this trait is directly linked to their invasiveness into standing root-associated communities. Our work has implications for sustainable agriculture through the development of persistent microbial inoculants. Less...	
PRJEB45568	The plastid-localised pseudo-protease FtsHi3 of Arabidopsis thaliana influences plant growth and tolerance to abiotic stress	While drought severely affects plant growth and crop production, the molecular mechanisms of the drought response of plants remain unclear. In this study, we demonstrated for the first time the effect of the pseudo-protease AtFtsHi3 of Arabidopsis thaliana on overall plant growth and in drought tolerance. An AtFTSHi3 knock-down mutant [ftshi3-1(kd)] displayed a pale-green phenotype with lower photosynthetic efficiency and Darwinian fitness compared to wild type (Wt). An observed delay in seed germination of ftshi3-1(kd) was attributed to overaccumulation of abscisic acid (ABA); ftshi3-1(kd) seedlings showed partial sensitivity to exogenous ABA. Being exposed to similar severity of soil drying, ftshi3-1(kd) was drought-tolerant up to 20 days after the last irrigation, while wild type plants wilted after 12 days. Leaves of ftshi3-1(kd) contained reduced stomata size, density, and a smaller stomatic aperture. During drought stress, ftshi3-1(kd) showed lowered stomatal conductance, increased intrinsic water-use efficiency (WUEi), and slower stress acclimation. Expression levels of ABA-responsive genes were higher in leaves of ftshi3-1(kd) than Wt; DREB1A, but not DREB2A, was significantly upregulated during drought. However, although ftshi3-1(kd) displayed a drought-tolerant phenotype in aboveground tissue, the root-associated bacterial community responded to drought. Less...	
PRJNA735616	Salt Responsive Alternative Splicing of a RING Finger E3 Ligase Modulates the Salt Stress Tolerance	Increasing evidence points to the tight relationship between alternative splicing (AS) and salt stress response. However, the insights into molecular regulatory mechanisms linking those two factors are limited. Here, we found that Salt Responsive Alternatively Spliced gene 1 (SRAS1), encoding a RING-Type E3 Ligase, generates two splicing variants: SRAS1.1 and SRAS1.2, which showed opposing responses to salt stress. The salt stress-responsive AS event thus resulted in greater accumulation of SRAS1.1 and a lower level of SRAS1.2. The full-length SRAS1.1 protein has E3 ubiquitin ligase activity while the truncated SRAS1.2 lacks E3 ligase activity. Less...

PRJNA686012	Coilin mutant suppressor screen identifies new modifiers of alternative splicing and posttranscriptional gene silencing in Arabidopsis	Coilin is a scaffold protein essential for the structural integrity of Cajal Bodies, which are non-membranous nuclear organelles that are thought to facilitate assembly and maturation of nuclear RNPs, including spliceosomal snRNPs. To investigate further coilin's functions in plant cells, we performed a genetic suppressor screen in Arabidopsis thaliana using a coilin (coi) mutant displaying altered splicing of a GFP pre-mRNA. The modified splicing pattern results in a 'hyper-GFP' phenotype in young coi seedlings relative to the intermediate level of GFP in wild-type seedlings. Additionally, in newly emerging leaves of older coi seedlings, the GFP gene frequently undergoes abrupt siRNA-associated posttranscriptional gene silencing that persists during growth. In the suppressor screen, we searched for mutations that subdue one or both of these GFP phenotypes and identified several understudied factors in plants: WRAP53, a putative Cajal body protein; SMU2, a predicted splicing-related factor; and ZC3HC1, an uncharacterized zinc finger protein. All three mutations return the hyper-GFP phenotype of the coi mutant to approximately the intermediate wild-type level. The zc3hc1 mutations in particular induce premature and more extensive posttranscriptional gene silencing similar to mutations in SOP1 and DCL4, which are known modifiers of posttranscriptional gene silencing. Our results demonstrate the usefulness of the coi mutant to identify new modifiers of alternative splicing and posttranscriptional gene silencing, and suggest diverse roles for coilin in plant cells.

Filtered reads were aligned to Arabidopsis thaliana genome using splice aware aligner like HISAT2 to quantify reads mapped to each transcript. Alignment percentage of reads were in the range of 96 percentage.Total number of unique mapped reads were counted using feature counts. The uniquely mapped reads were subjected to differential gene expression using DESEQ2.Alternate splicing analysis was performed using rMATS using paired replicates T1, T2 (plus) and T1, T2 (minus) samples.Our study represents the first detailed analysis of HopA1 effector triggered immunity transcriptome independent of EDS1 target, with biological replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our data indicate early and independent EDS1 defense response after HopA1 perception in planta. We conclude that RNA-seq based transcriptome characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and permit the dissection of complex biologic functions of both HopA1 effector and EDS1 protein from plant during effector triggered immunity.

PRJNA749854	Noncanonical mono(ADP-ribosyl)ation of zinc finger SZF proteins counteracts ubiquitination for protein homeostasis in plant immunity	Protein ADP-ribosylation is a reversible post-translational modification that transfers ADP-ribose from NAD+ onto acceptor proteins1-3. Poly(ADP-ribosy)lation (PARylation), catalyzed by poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases (PARPs), and poly(ADP-ribose) glycohydrolases (PARGs), which remove the modification, regulates diverse cellular processes1-3. However, the chemistry and physiological functions of mono(ADP-ribosy)lation (MARylation) remain elusive. Here, we report that the Arabidopsis zinc finger proteins SZF1 and SZF2, key regulators of immune gene expression, are MARylated by the noncanonical ADP-ribosyltransferase SRO2. Immune elicitation promotes MARylation of SZF1/SZF2 via dissociation from PARG1, which has an unconventional activity in hydrolyzing both poly(ADP-ribose) and mono(ADP-ribose) from acceptor proteins. MARylation antagonizes the polyubiquitination of SZF1 mediated by the SH3 domain-containing proteins SH3P1/SH3P2, thereby stabilizing SZF1 proteins to relay immune signaling. Our study uncovers the previously unrecognized enzymes mediating MARylation of vital immune regulators and underpins a unique mechanism of maintaining protein homeostasis by the counter-regulation of ADP-ribosylation and polyubiquitination to ensure proper immune responses.

PRJNA664641	pH-Dependent Transcriptional Profile Changes in Iron-Deficient Arabidopsis Roots	Iron is an essential element for plants and abundantly present in most mineral soils. The mobility of iron is, however, dependent on the redox potential and hydrogen activity (pH) of the soil, factors that may limit its availability to plants in particular at alkaline pHs. Iron deficiency triggers pronounced changes in the transcriptional profile of plants, inducing processes that aid in the acquisition, uptake, and translocation of iron. How ambient pH impact the transcriptional iron deficiency response has not yet been elucidated in detail. Here, we provide an RNA-seq data set that catalogs global gene expression changes of iron-deficient plants grown at either optimal (5.5) or high (7.0) pH. A suite of 857 genes changed significantly and more than twofold in expression; only 54 genes of this suite were also differentially expressed between iron-deficient and iron-sufficient plants grown at pH 5.5. Among the high pH-responsive genes, 186 were earlier shown to be responsive to short-term transfer to low pH, 91 genes of this subset were anti-directionally regulated by high and low pH. The latter subset contained genes involved in cell wall organization, auxin homeostasis, and potential hubs of yet undefined signaling circuits. Growing iron-deficient plants at high pH also modulated the transcriptional iron deficiency response observed at pH 5.5 by compromising the enzymatic reduction of ferric chelates and favoring the production of iron-mobilizing coumarins. It is concluded that ambient pH is an important determinant of global gene expression which tunes iron acquisition to the prevailing edaphic conditions. Less...	
PRJNA662088	A. thaliana ILK1 modulated transcriptome under biotic and abiotic stress	Plants have integrated signaling networks that modulate the perception of signal and responses to environmental stresses including abiotic and biotic stress factors that affect crop productivity in many agricultural areas. Here we characterized the functions of INTEGRIN-LINKED KINASE1 (ILK1), a plant Raf-like MAP3K, in modulating dynamics of transcriptional responses following pathogen challenge. Analysis of mutants altered in ILK1 expression or kinase activity revealed kinase-dependent and independent ILK1 roles in PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI); ILK1 was also necessary for the control of ion homeostasis during PTI. ilk1 mutant and control samples were subjected to RNAseq analysis to identify differentially expressed genes that relay on ILK1 activity during PAMP (Pathogen-associated Molecular Pattern) challenge. A global transcriptomic analysis revealed ILK1's role in modulating the temporal dynamics and range of Arabidopsis transcriptional re-programming post-flg22 treatment. Less...

Little is known about sulphur sensing signalling in plants, mainly hindered by the innate capacity of plant cells to produce myriad complexity of sulphur-containing amino acids and compounds via sulphur assimilation pathway. To better understand the molecular landscape of the sulphate-TOR signalling network in shoot apex activation, we performed RNA-seq analyses to compare transcriptome changes specifically in shoot apex trigger by 2 h treatment of 10 uM sulphate, 10 uM Cys or 10 uM GSH in sulphate-starved seedlings with or without Torin2 supply.

PRJNA674748	Alternative splicing generates a MONOPTEROS isoform required for ovule development.	The plant hormone auxin is a fundamental regulator of organ patterning and development that regulates gene expression via the canonical AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) and AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (Aux/IAA) combinatorial system. ARF and Aux/IAA factors interact, but at high auxin concentrations, the Aux/IAA transcriptional repressor is degraded, allowing ARF-containing complexes to activate gene expression. ARF5/MONOPTEROS (MP) is an important integrator of auxin signallingin Arabidopsis development and activates gene transcription in cells with elevated auxin levels. Here, we show that in ovules, MP is expressed in cells with low levels of auxin and can activate the expression of direct target genes. We identified and characterized a splice variant of MP that encodes a biologically functional isoform that lacks the Aux/IAA interaction domain. This MP11ir isoform was able to complement inflorescence, floral and ovule developmental defects in mp mutants, suggesting that it was fully functional.Our findings describe a novel scenario in which ARF post-transcriptional regulation controls the formation of an isoform that can function as a transcriptional activator in regions of subthreshold auxin concentration.

PRJNA678646	XVEpro:ABI3 line 3 (fus3-T as background)	ABA-INSENSITIVE 3 (ABI3) has long been known for activation of storage protein accumulation and it has regulatory interaction with FUSCA3 (FUS3), an activator of oil accumulation. However, the role of ABI3 in oil accumulation and its interaction with FUS3 remain unclear. Expressing ABI3 in rosette leaves of fus3 knock-out mutant still caused up to three-fold greater triacylglycerol accumulation, indicating ABI3 can activate lipid accumulation independently of FUS3. Transcriptome analysis revealed that lipid droplet protein (LDP) genes including OLEOSINs and CALEOSINs were highly up-regulated up to 1000 times by ABI3 in the absence of FUS3, while the expression of WRI1 was doubled. ABI3 activates oil accumulation with or without FUS3, most likely through up-regulating LDPs and WRI1. Less...	
PRJNA690701	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	Isoprene (C5H8), the most abundant biogenic volatile hydrocarbon in the atmosphere, is constitutively released by the leaves of some of the fastest-growing and most speciose forest trees1. While isoprene influences global climate, it also serves emitting plants by mitigating heat and oxidative stresses. However, we do not understand why isoprene emission is constitutive and not merely stress-induced. Using Arabidopsis genetically transformed to emit isoprene, and naturally isoprene-emitting poplar trees where isoprene biosynthesis was suppressed, here we show that the ability to emit isoprene significantly enhances the abundance of leaf cytokinins (CKs), a group of vital growth hormones regulating plant development and senescence. Genes regulating CK-synthesis, CK-signaling and CK-degradation are significantly overexpressed in isoprene-emitting leaves. By priming leaf CK-metabolism, isoprene emission accelerates plant growth, affects chloroplast metabolic rate and leaf energy status, induces early leaf senescence, and shortens plant generation time. The results unveil a hitherto unknown evolutionary and house-keeping function for constitutive isoprene emission in shaping plant life-history strategies. Less...

PRJNA660263	Transcriptional and imprinting complexity in Arabidopsis seeds at single-nucleus resolution (thale cress)	"Seeds are the basis of agriculture, yet their full transcriptional complexity has remained unknown. Here, we employ single-nucleus RNA-sequencing to characterize developing Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, with a focus on endosperm. Endosperm, the site of gene imprinting in plants, mediates the relationship between the maternal parent and embryo. We identify new cell types in the chalazal endosperm region, which interfaces with maternal tissue for nutrient unloading. We further demonstrate that the extent of parental bias of maternally expressed imprinted genes varies with cell cycle phase, and that imprinting of paternally expressed imprinted genes is strongest in chalazal endosperm. These data indicate imprinting in endosperm is heterogeneous and suggest that parental conflict, which is proposed to drive the evolution of imprinting, is fiercest at the boundary between filial and maternal tissues.
Overall design: To identify cell/nuclei types and investigate imprinting dynamics within endosperm, single nucleus RNA-seq was performed using the Smart-seq2 method on seed nuclei, targeting either the 3C or 6C FANS peak in order to enrich for triploid endosperm (other seed tissues are diploid). A total of 1,664 libraries were sequenced, of which 64 were negative controls (no DNA in library prep or no cell sorted), 51 were made from two nuclei to test single-nuclei sorting accuracy, 112 failed QC checks (< 1,500 genes detected and/or <1,000 detected with 5+ reads), and the remaining 1,437 were high-quality single-nuclei libraries used in final analysis. The final dataset consists primarily of seeds derived from Col, Cvi reciprocal crosses at 4 days after pollination (DAP), although some nuclei were instead obtained from Col, Ler crosses and/or other timepoints.
Please note that the counts.txt files for the P17_10A, P21_10A, and P22_10A samples are identical as they are from negative controls that should not have any reads mapping to A. thaliana.
There are  ~50 negative controls in the dataset, and most have at least one or two reads falling in a gene somewhere and so the processed data files (read counts per gene) aren't exactly the same, but the read counts in all three files are actually zero for all genes, so all three files are identical."

PRJNA661303	Gene expression responses to ABA and to osmotic stress in the bon123 triple mutant (thale cress)	"Hyperosmotic stress caused by drought and salinity is a significant environmental threat that limits plant growth and agricultural productivity. Osmotic stress induces diverse responses in plants including Ca2+ signaling, accumulation of the stress hormone abscisic acid (ABA), reprogramming of gene expression, and altering growth. Despite intensive investigation, no global regulators of all of these responses have been identified. Here, we show that the Ca2+-responsive phospholipid binding BONZAI (BON) proteins are critical for all of these osmotic stress responses. A Ca2+-imaging-based forward genetic screen identified a loss-of-function bon1 mutant with a reduced cytosolic Ca2+ signal in response to hyperosmotic stress. The loss-of-function mutants of the BON1 gene family, bon1bon2bon3, are impaired in the induction of gene expression and ABA accumulation in response to osmotic stress. In addition, the bon mutants are hypersensitive to osmotic stress in growth inhibition. BON genes have been shown to negatively regulate plant immune responses mediated by intracellular immune receptor NLR genes including SNC1. We found that the defects of the bon mutants in osmotic stress responses were suppressed by mutations in the NLR gene SNC1 or the immunity regulator PAD4. Our findings indicate that NLR signaling represses osmotic stress responses and that BON proteins suppress NLR signaling to enable global osmotic stress responses in plants.
Overall design: Wild type and bon123t mutant seedlings were grown vertically for 9 days before treatment. These seedlings were mock treated, or treated with 100 µM ABA or 300 mM mannitol for 24 hours on 1/2 MS medium.

In this study, the interaction between the salt stress tolerance-inducing beneficial bacterium Enterobacter sp. SA187 and Arabidopsis was investigated with a special focus on the plant immune system. Among the immune signalling mutants, the Lys-motif receptors LYK4  strongly affected the beneficial interaction. Overexpression of the chitin receptor components LYK4 compromised the beneficial effect of SA187 on Arabidopsis.

PRJNA662919	A pair of effectors in a conditionally dispensable chromosome of Fusarium oxysporum suppresses host-specific immunity	"In plant pathogenic fungi, conditionally dispensable (CD) chromosomes are often associated with virulence, but not viability. Such virulence-associated CD chromosomes carry genes encoding effectors and/or host-specific toxin biosynthesis enzymes, potentially important for determining host specificity. Fusarium oxysporum causes devastating diseases of more than 100 plant species. In particular, F. oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans (Focn) can infect Brassicaceae plants including Arabidopsis and cabbage. Here we show that Focn has multiple CD chromosomes involving in not only virulence but also vegetative growth, which is an atypical feature of known CD chromosomes. Among them, we identified specific CD chromosomes that are required for virulence to either Arabidopsis, cabbage, or both. We revealed that a pair of effectors encoded in one of the CD chromosomes is required for suppression of the Arabidopsis-specific phytoalexin-based immunity. The effector pair is highly conserved in F. oxysporum isolates capable of infecting Arabidopsis. This study provides insights into how host specificity of F. oxysporum is determined by a pair of effector genes on a CD chromosome.
Overall design: For pre-incubation, Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. conglutinans Cong:1-1 (FocnCong:1-1) was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) at 28°C under dark. For bud cell production, FocnCong:1-1 was grown in NO3 medium (0.17% yeast nitrogen base without amino acids, 3% sucrose and 1% KNO3) at 120 strokes per minute (spm) for 4 days at 28°C under dark. For expression profiling, mycelia were harvested after 10 days of incubation on PDA at 28°C. Bud cells were collected from the above culture in NO3 medium by filtration with a nylon mesh and centrifugation. Hyphae trapped with the nylon mesh were dried and collected. Mycelia (PDA), bud cells and hyphae were stored in a tube at -80°C until RNA isolation. In addition, 20 or 21 day-old Arabidopsis Col-0 and 17 day-old cabbage cv. Shosyu roots were irrigated with 1 ml of the FocnCong:1-1 bud cell suspension (1 × 10^7 cells/ml). At 3 dpi and 10 dpi, infected roots were washed with water to remove soil and then dried. The roots were stored in a tube at -80°C until RNA isolation. RNA sequencing was performed by deep sequencing on Illumina NextSeq 500 using a custom high-throughput method (Front Plant Sci 2012, 3:202).

PRJNA663790	Ectopic targeting of CG DNA methylation in Arabidopsis with the bacterial SssI methyltransferase. (thale cress)	"Targeting of epigenetic marks like DNA methylation to specific loci to manipulate gene expression is important in both basic research and in crop plant engineering. However, the extent to which targeted DNA methylation can be heritable is unknown. Here, we show that targeting the CG-specific methyltransferase M.SssI (SssI) from Spiroplasma sp. strain MQ1 with an artificial zinc finger (ZF) protein can establish heritable CG methylation and silencing of the targeted loci in Arabidopsis. This occurs even in the absence of a functional RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway, which is usually required for de novo methylation. In addition to the locus-specific targeted CG methylation, we observed widespread ectopic CG methylation throughout the genome that was highly heritable over generations, even in the absence of the effector transgene. A comparison with other epigenetic features showed that this ectopic methylation occurred preferentially at less open chromatin regions that were lacking in positive epigenetic histone marks. Although ectopic CG methylation was highly enriched over gene body regions, it showed little effect on transcription of these genes. However, we observed a mild but significant reduction in the histone variant H2A.Z and H3K27me3 over genes with ectopic CG methylation. These results outline general principals of the interaction of CG methylation with other epigenomic features that should help guide future efforts to engineer epigenomes.

Methods: RNA-seq was employed to assess transcriptional profiles in treated and non-treated A. thaliana calli. We sequenced two cDNA libraries developed from A. thaliana (wild type Col-0) calli treated with 1µM Cycloatragenol and without. The sequence reads that was filtered, were mapped, aligned and then compared to the reference annotation (the known genes of A. thaliana genome) using Cufflinks tools. Clean data was analyzed using CPC software and results were validated by qRT-PCR using TaqMan and SYBER green assays. Results: We mapped around 63 and 70 million sequence reads from, respectively, control and CAG-treated samples. After filtration and mapping about 21 thousands genes corresponding to an average of 34 thousands transcripts, for each sample were identified. 1045 genes showed differential expression between control and treated sample with a p value < 0.05.

PRJNA665187	Differential alteration of plant functions by homologous fungal candidate effectors (thale cress)	"Rust fungi are plant pathogens that cause epidemics which threatens the production of many important plant species, such as wheat, soy, coffee and poplar. Melampsora larici-populina (Mlp) causes the poplar rust and encodes at least 1 184 candidate effectors (CEs), however their functions are poorly known. In this study, we analysed the transcriptome and metabolome of Arabidopsis constitutively expressing CEs of Mlp to discover processes targeted by these fungal proteins. For this purpose, we sequenced the transcriptome and used mass spectrometry to analyse the metabolome of Arabidopsis plants expressing one of 14 selected CEs and of a control line. We found 2 299 deregulated genes in at least one of the 14 transgenic lines. Among the down-regulated genes, the KEGG pathways MAPK signaling pathway and Plant-pathogen interaction were over-represented in six and five of the 14 transgenic lines, respectively. Moreover, the genes down-regulated across the fourteen transgenic lines are related to hormone response and defense. Regarding the metabolome, there were 680 metabolites deregulated across the 14 transgenic lines, with highly unsaturated and phenolic compounds and peptides enriched among down-regulated and up-regulated metabolites, respectively, in almost all transgenic lines. Interestingly, we found that some transgenic lines expressing CEs with no similarity in amino acid sequence had similar patterns of gene and metabolite deregulation, while plants expressing CEs from the same family deregulated different genes and metabolites. Taken together, our results indicate that the sequence of effectors may not be a good predictor of its impact in the plant.

PRJNA665236	Time of day prioritizes the pool of translating mRNAs in response to heat stress (thale cress)	"The circadian clock helps organisms to anticipate and coordinate gene regulatory responses to changes in environmental stimuli. Under growth limiting temperatures, time of day modulates the accumulation of polyadenylated mRNAs. In response to heat stress, plants will conserve energy and selectively translate mRNAs. How the clock and/or time of day regulates polyadenylated mRNAs bound by ribosomes in response to heat stress is unknown. In-depth analysis of Arabidopsis thaliana translating mRNAs found that time of day gates the response of approximately one-third of the circadian regulated heat responsive translatome. Specifically, time of day and heat stress interact to prioritize the pool of mRNAs in cue to be translated. For a subset of mRNAs, we observed a stronger gated response during the day, and preferentially before the peak of expression. We propose previously overlooked transcription factors (TFs) as regulatory nodes and show that the clock plays a role in the temperature response for select TFs. When the stress was removed, the redefined priorities for translation recovered within one-hour, though slower recovery was observed for abiotic stress regulators. Through hierarchical network connections between clock genes and prioritized TFs, our work provides a framework to target key nodes underlying heat stress tolerance throughout the day.

Due to cell-type specific expression of tagged ribosomes, ribosome-bound mRNA was isolated to obtain cell-layer translatomes. After inoculation with the vascular pathogen Verticillium longisporum, the pathogenic oomycete Phytophthora parasitica and the mutualistic endophyte Serendipita indica, we determined root responses on a cell-layer resolution. These data reflect the fundamentally different colonization strategies of the microbes. Mining the data-set, we identified a Verticillium specific suppression of the endodermal barrier restricting fungal progression, localized biosynthesis of antimicrobial compounds, and observed a pathogen-specific arrest of root meristems correlated with ethylene biosynthesis.

PRJNA666436	A single cell view of the transcriptome during lateral root initiation (thale cress)	"Plant root architecture is a major determinant of fitness, and is under constant modification in response to favorable and unfavorable environmental stimuli. Beyond impacts on the primary root, the environment can also alter the position, spacing, density, and length of secondary or lateral roots. Lateral root development is among the best-studied developmental processes in Arabidopsis thaliana, yet the earliest steps of organogenesis remain elusive. Among the challenges faced in capturing these early molecular events is the fact that this process occurs in a small number of cells with unpredictable timing. The advent of single-cell sequencing affords the opportunity to isolate cells undergoing this fate transition and examine their transcriptomes independently. Using this approach, we successfully captured the transcriptomes of lateral root primordia and discovered many previously unreported upregulated genes. To further study this process, we developed a method to selectively repress genes in the xylem pole pericycle cells where lateral roots originate. We found that expression of several of the upregulated genes was required for normal root development. In addition, we discovered a subpopulation of cells in the endodermal cell file that respond to lateral root initiation, further highlighting the benefits of the single cell approach.
Overall design: Using the 10X single cell transcriptomics platform, we isolated cells from Arabidopsis roots to study lateral root formation. To stimulate lateral root formation, Arabidopsis seedlings were rotated 90 degrees and cells from the root bend were captured 08 hours, and 20 hours after the stimulus. Cells from a no bend control, 00 hours, were collected as well.

PRJNA666544	Transcriptional responses of wild-type and zin1 mutant Arabidopsis plants to infection with Pseudomonas syringae (thale cress)	"Phytopathogens use secreted effector proteins to suppress host immunity and promote pathogen virulence, and there is increasing evidence that the host-pathogen interactome comprises a complex network.  In an effort to identify novel interactors of the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopZ1a, we performed a yeast two-hybrid screen that identified a previously uncharacterized Arabidopsis protein that we designate HopZ1a Interactor 1 (ZIN1).  Additional analyses in yeast and in planta revealed that ZIN1 also interacts with several other P. syringae effectors.  We show that an Arabidopsis loss-of-function zin1 mutant is less susceptible to infection by certain strains of P. syringae, while overexpression of ZIN1 results in enhanced susceptibility.  Functionally, ZIN1 exhibits topoisomerase-like activity in vitro.  Transcriptional profiling of wild-type and zin1 Arabidopsis plants inoculated with P. syringae indicated that ZIN1 regulates a wide range of pathogen-responsive biological processes, although the list of genes more highly expressed in zin1 versus wild-type plants was particularly enriched for ribosomal protein genes.  Altogether, these data illuminate ZIN1 as a potential susceptibility hub that interacts with multiple effectors to influence the outcome of plant-microbe interactions.
Overall design: Wild-type and zin1 mutants infiltrated with either 10 mM MgCl2 (Control), 1 x 10^8 cfu/mL Pseudmonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, or 1 x 10^8 cfu/mL P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 ΔhrcC (three biological replicates each for a total of 18 samples) Less..."

PRJNA666917	The impact of the genes BBX32 and HY5 on the high light - responsive transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Exposure of mature fully expanded leaves of Arabidopsis to a 7.5 fold increased light intensity  above  growth light conditions (high light; HL) tirggers stress defensive responses  but also initiates cellular processes, that if such conditions persist, can lead to increased photosynthetic capacity. This process is called dynamic acclimation. By using variational Bayesian state space modelling on eariler GEO deposited time series HL data (see GSE78251) a gene regulatory network of (co) transcription factor genes was inferred. The most connected gene in this network is BBX32, which was subequently shown  to be a negative regulator of dynamic acclimation. Also present in the inferred network is HY5, which is known from studies on seedling photomorphogenesis to be antagonistic in its action to BBX32. Subsequently, it was demonstrated that HY5 is indeed a positive regulator of dynamic acclimation.  This RNAseq-based study seeks  to provide gene expression data that will help to link the immediate impact of these genes on the HL transcriptome to the longer term (several days) physiological manifestation of dynamic acclimation.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana (genotype Col-0) that over-express BBX32 (BBX32-10; Holtan et al. (2011) Plant Physiology 156: 2109-2123) and are null for HY5 (hy5-2; Ruckle et al. (2007) Plant Cell 19: 3944-3960) produce the same degree of inhibition of the quantum efficiency of photosynthetic elecron transport upon sustained expsure to HL, both genotypes failing to undergo dynamic acclimation.  Therefore, similar cohorts of genes may be affected in short term HL exposure. Therefore, plants were exposed to HL for 3.5h and then sampled for RNA from their fully expanded leaves. low light control samples were to be run in parallel. The duration of the HL exposure was chosen because based on time sereis daat most inductio of differential expression of genes was completed after this time. These data allow for the initial validation of the gene regulatory network centred on BBX32 (as well as future iterations and variations of this network), but will also, with further analysis yet to be done,  allow the identification of key genes downstream from BBX32 and HY5 that control both initial responses to HL and the establishment of dynamic acclimation.

PRJNA666927	Combinations of maternal-specific repressive epigenetic marks in the endosperm control seed dormancy (thale cress)	"Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2)-mediated trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) and methylation of histone 3 on lysine 9 (H3K9me) are two repressive epigenetic modifications that are typically localized in distinct regions of the genome. For reasons unknown, however, they co-occur in some organisms and special tissue types. In this study, we show that maternal alleles marked by H3K27me3 in the Arabidopsis endosperm were targeted by the H3K27me3 demethylase REF6 and became activated during germination. In contrast, maternal alleles marked by H3K27me3, H3K9me2, and CHG methylation (CHGm) are likely to be protected from REF6 targeting and remained silenced. Our study unveils that combinations of different repressive epigenetic modifications time a key adaptive trait by modulating access of REF6.
Overall design: Endosperm tissues were dissected from germinating seeds of Arabidopsis thaliana and analysed in two parallel experiments. Firstly, by comparing three replicates of wild type against three replicates of the ref6-1 mutant. Secondly, by comparing three new replicates of wild type against three replicates of the suvh456 mutant. Total RNA was extracted using MagMAX™ Plant RNA Isolation Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific), and cDNA libraries were constructed using the NEBNext® Ultra™ II RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB).

PRJNA669025	TRH1/KUP4 is a coupler of auxin-mediated root system architecture responses in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"TRH1, also classified as KUP4, belongs in the family of plant HAK/KUP/KT (High-Affinity K+/ K+ UPtake/ K+ Transporter) transporters, homologous to the bacterial KUP and fungal HAK transporters, which most likely as K+/H+ exchangers function as electrochemical potential-driven transporters. Arabidopsis contains 13 genes, classified into five major clades (Clades I-V). Members of Clade II, including TRH1, are associated with developmental processes. Targeted expression experiments demonstrated that K+ transporter TRH1 is a coupler of two auxin-mediated developmental processes that determine Root System Architecture, root hair morphogenesis and root gravitropism. Targeting TRH1 expression in central cylinder cells that coincide with the acropetal route of auxin transport, rescued trh1 root agravitropism, whereas positional TRH1 expression in peripheral cell layers that define the basipetal route of auxin transport, restored trh1 root hair defects. To dissect the two auxin-mediated developmental responses, a transcriptome analysis was performed identifying the differentially expressed genes involved in either root bending or root hair development.
Overall design: For the transcriptome studies, ~1 mm sections of root tips from trh1, pPIN1::TRH1-YFP and pPIN2::TRH1-YFP transgenic lines were collected for RNA-Seq analysis. Total RNA was extracted using the Direct-zol RNA Miniprep (Zymo research, Irvine CA, USA) kit with an on-column DNase treatment according to the manufacturer’s instructions.

PRJNA672150	A. thaliana WT and ICT1 mutant treated vs. non treated with I3C (thale cress)	"We work with Arabidopsis thaliana. One of the things we focus on is a secondary metabolite named Indol 3 carbinol (I3C). This molecule is synthesized following insect attack (wounding). We have noticed that addition of I3C to the growth medium causes inhibition of plant/bacterial/fungal growth. We have discovered that I3C also affects different pathways in the plant. By screening overexpression library we have found Arabidopsis mutants that overexpress S30 gene (ribosomal subunit of 40s) are tolerant to the addition of I3C (their growth is less affected by the addition of I3C).
To understand better I3C mode of action we have planned the following transcriptome experiment:   1. To see what are the pathways activated following wounding, we took the wt Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) and kept one group of plants untreated (control) and the other was wounded (8 hours).   2. To see what are the pathways activated following incubation with 2 concentrations of I3C, we took the wt Arabidopsis thaliana (Col-0) and kept one group of plants untreated (control) and the other was incubated for 2 hours with 200µM (physiological concentration) and 400µM I3C.  3. To see if there are any differences in gene expression between the wt and the mutants, we took wt and 2 I3C tolerant mutants. Neither of them was treated.  4.

PRJNA674046	SCL15 is a critical regulator for plant development, germination, seed dormancy and seed vigor in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Seed maturation, dormancy and germination are distinct physiological processes. Transition from maturation to dormancy, and from dormancy into germination are not only critical developmental phases in the plant life cycle but are also important agricultural traits. These developmental processes and their phase transitions are fine determined and coordinately regulated by genetic makeup and environmental cues. SCARECROW-LIKE15 (SCL15) has been demonstrated to be essential for repressing the seed maturation programme in vegetative tissues (Gao et al., Nat Commun, 2015, 6:7243). Here we report that SCL15 is also important for seed dormancy maintenance, germination timing and seed vigor performance based on the effects of SCL15 mutation on plant germination, growth and reproduction when compared with wild type Arabidopsis and over-expression lines 35S:SCL15 and Napin:SCL15. Seed dormancy is enhanced by the mutation of SCL15 in a GA signaling dependent way, indicating that SCL15 plays a negative role for primary dormancy release. Seed germination is positively regulated by SCL15 through interaction with ABA, GA and auxin signaling. SCL15 acts as positive regulator of seed vigor and effect of SCL15 mRNA abundance on seed reserve accumulation and seed development during late embryogenesis may contribute to the seed vigor performance.

PRJNA674629	Transcriptomic responses of Arabidopsis thaliana lines WS and sku5 to the Blue Origin NS-12 and Virgin Galactic VP-03 suborbital flights (thale cress)	"The increasing availability of flights on suborbital rockets creates new avenues for the study of spaceflight effects on biological systems, in particular the transitions between hypergravity and microgravity. This paper presents an initial comparison of the responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to suborbital and atmospheric parabolic flights as an important step toward characterizing these emerging suborbital platforms and their effects on biology. Transcriptomic profiling of the response of the Arabidopsis ecotype Wassilewskija (WS) to the aggregate spaceflight experiences in the Blue Origin New Shepard and Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo rockets revealed that the transcriptomic load induced by flight differed greatly between the two flights, yet was biologically related to traditional parabolic flight responses. The sku5 skewing mutant and 14-3-3κ:GFP regulatory protein overexpression lines each showed altered intra-platform responses compared to WS in the Blue Origin and parabolic flights, respectively. An additional parabolic flight using the F-104 Starfighter showed that the response of 14-3-3κ:GFP to flight was modulated in a similar manner to the WS line. Despite the differing genotypes, experimental workflows, flight profiles and platforms, alteration of gene expression remodeling central metabolic processes was commonly observed as a response to the flights. The processes included carbon and nitrogen metabolism, branched-chain amino acid degradation, and hypoxic responses. The timing and directionality of differentially-expressed genes involved in the conserved pathways differed among the platforms. The data presented herein highlight the potential for various suborbital platforms to contribute insights into biological responses to spaceflight, and further suggest that in-flight fixation during suborbital experiments will provide insights into responses to each phase of flight.
Overall design: Multiple genotypes of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were flown on either the Virgin Galactic SpaceShipTwo (VG VP-03; Col-0 and WS) or Blue Origin New Shepard (BO NS-12; WS and sku5) suborbital flight platforms.

PRJNA675765	A MKP-MAPK protein phosphorylation cascade controls vascular disease resistance in plants (thale cress)	"Vascular plant diseases, such as rice bacterial blight caused by Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzae (Xoo) and crucifer black rot caused by Xanthomonas campestris pv. campestris (Xcc), cause huge yield loss of crops worldwide. However, how plants operate vascular defense against these obligate pathogens remains elusive. In this study, we used both Arabidopsis and rice pathosystems to address the long-standing question.  We found that the loss of function mutation of Arabidopsis mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) phosphatase 1 (MKP1) lost the non-host resistance to Xoo and supported Xoo to grow in the leaf veins, which also enhanced susceptibility to Xcc. MKP1 regulates the MPK3-mediated phosphorylation of the transcription factor MYB4 that functions in vascular lignification. Importantly, the MKP-MAPK cascade-mediated lignin biosynthesis is also conserved in rice through regulating OsMYB102 and OsMYB108, which control rice vascular resistance to adapted Xoo. Interestingly, the Arabidopsis and rice mutants enhanced resistance to the mesophyll cell pathogens most likely through upregulating salicylic acid biosynthesis, Pseudomonas syringae (P. syringae) and Xanthomonas oryzae pv. oryzicole (Xoc), respectively; strongly suggesting that this immune mechanism is likely specific to the obligate vascular pathogens. Therefore, our study uncovers a previously unrecognized vascular-specific and lignin-based immune mechanism, shedingshedding new sight on tissue-specific immunity in plants, as well as providing a practical approach for improvement of disease resistance against vascular pathogens in crops

PRJNA678688	Conserved and unique features of the SAGA complex in plants [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) complex is an evolutionarily conserved, multifunctional co-activator complex, which has a critical role in histone acetylation, gene expression, and various developmental processes in eukaryotes. However, little is known about the composition and function of the SAGA complex in plants. Here, we found that the SAGA complex in Arabidopsis thaliana contains not only conserved subunits and but also four plant-specific subunits, including three homologous subunits, SCS1, SCS2A, and SCS2B (SCS1/2A/2B), and a TAF-like subunit, TAFL. We also found that a series of SAGA subunits are shared in yeast and/or metazoans but are absent in Arabidopsis. Mutations in the unique SAGA subunits SCS1/2A/2B lead to defective phenotypes similar to those caused by mutations in the conserved SAGA subunits HAG1 and ADA2B; these defective phenotypes include delayed juvenile-to-adult phase transition, late flowering, and increased trichome density. SCS1/2A/2B function in the SAGA complex to promote the transcription of development-related genes by facilitating histone H3 acetylation. The results suggest that, compared to SAGA complexes in other eukaryotes, the SAGA complex in plants has evolved unique features that are necessary for normal growth and development.

PRJNA678733	The Arabidopsis NOT4A E3 ligase promotes PGR3 expression and regulates chloroplast translation (thale cress)	"Chloroplast function requires the coordinated action of nuclear- and chloroplast-derived proteins, including several hundred nuclear-encoded pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins that regulate plastid mRNA metabolism. Despite their large number and importance, regulatory mechanisms controlling PPR expression are poorly understood. Here we show that the Arabidopsis NOT4A ubiquitin-ligase positively regulates the expression of PROTON GRADIENT REGULATION 3 (PGR3), a PPR protein required for translating several thylakoid-localised photosynthetic components and ribosome subunits within chloroplasts. Loss of NOT4A function leads to a strong depletion of cytochrome b6f and NDH complexes, as well plastid 30S ribosomes, which reduces mRNA translation and negatively impacts photosynthetic capacity, causing pale-yellow and slow-growth phenotypes. Quantitative transcriptome and proteome analyses reveal that PGR3 is misregulated in not4a. We show that the molecular not4a defects mimic those of a pgr3 mutant, and that normal plastid function is restored through transgenic PGR3 expression. Our work identifies NOT4A as crucial for ensuring robust photosynthetic function during development and stress-response, through promoting PGR3 production and chloroplast translation.

PRJNA678965	Nurse cell­-derived small RNAs define paternal epigenetic inheritance in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"We report here that gentic methylation in the male germline, from meiocytes to sperm, is established by siRNAs transcribed from transposons with imperfect sequence homology. These siRNAs are synthesized by meiocyte nurse cells (tapetum) via activity of the chromatin remodeler CLASSY3, which is specifically expressed in tapetal cells. Plants that produce siRNAs only in the tapetum have broadly normal DNA methylation of the entire germline. Finally, we also report that these nurse cell-derived siRNAs (niRNAs) silence germline transposons, thereby safeguarding genome integrity. Our results reveal the crucial role of tapetal niRNAs in germline methylation reprogramming, which is remarkably analogous to piRNA-mediated reprogramming in animal germlines.

PRJNA679226	Natural variation in activation of KAI2/HTL pathway promotes germination in the dark in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Elucidating direct roles of natural variation in biological processes has been challenging due to the difficulty in dissecting the causal role of a gene in traits displaying continuous variation. The decision of a seed to germinate is an easily quantifiable binary choice, which makes it an ideal phenotype to assess the contribution of natural variation in adaptation of plants to begin their lifecycle under optimal conditions. seeds must integrate a complex array of environmental signals to begin their lifecycle under optimal conditions. Light availability is a crucial environmental stimulus that promotes germination in many small seed plant species including Arabidopsis thaliana. Upon perception of light by photoreceptors, phytohormones act as internal signals to coordinate germination but the karrikin (KAR) signalling pathway through the HTL/KAI2 receptor is thought to play a rudimentary role in Arabidopsis germination (REF). Here we show that the AtHTL/KAI2 pathway is required and sufficient to promote germination under low light conditions. Activation of the AtHTL/KAI2 receptor by nanomolar Karrikin2 (KAR2) concentrations or inactivation of SMAX1 bypass the light requirement for germination. By performing a screen of A. thaliana accessions that can germinate under low light conditions, we identified an accession from Afghanistan (Ara-1) which misexpressed AtKAI2/HTL and had a nearly identical transcriptional signature to the activation of AtKAI2 upon addition of KAR2 in the reference accession. Our data suggest that AtKAI2 is a central regulator of germination in natural Arabidopsis populations in response to light availability, to optimize germination timing in their ecological niche.

PRJNA679555	Genome wide analysis of the chromatin state and gene expression in Wild-type, tor-es mutant, and fie mutants (thale cress)	"Using Western blot, we found the level of H3K27me3, but not H3K4me3, H3K9me2 and H3K36me3, was specifically reduced in the tor-es mutant. To gain a genome-wide view of the effects of TOR activity on H3K27me3 distribution, we performed quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation with an exogenous reference genome (ChIP-Rx) followed by deep-sequencing. We find a global reduction of H3K27me3 occupancy in tor-es, whereas the H3K9me2 level was largely unaffected. These results suggest that TOR may be a specific and direct regulator of global deposition of H3K27me3.
To investigate the function of TOR phosphorylation of FIE, we complemented the heterozygous fie/+ plants with GFP-FIE or the phosphorylation site mutant (SSTS/AAAA) under the control of the FIE promoter. To provide a parallel comparison with SSTS/AAAA/fie, we generated estradiol-inducible fie-amiR-es transgenic lines, that eliminated FIE protein. Quantitative ChIP-seq analyses revealed greatly reduced H3K27me3 levels across the genome in SSTS/AAAA and fie-amiR-es mutants. And transcriptome profiling by RNA-Seq was conducted to globally identify thousands of genes coordinately dysregulated in the shoots of SSTS/AAAA and fie-amiR-es plants. Furthermore, gene Ontology analysis of 986 TOR-FIE-PRC2 target genes revealed significant enrichment for transcription factors/regulators controlling a broad spectrum of developmental programs.

We examined the specificity of CuAAC and SPAAC reactions towards NAD+ vs. m7G, and found that both prefer NAD+ but also act on m7G. We show that m7G-capped RNA can be immuno-depleted, allowing for the specific identification of NAD-RNA via the SPAAC reaction and sequencing, which we name SPAAC-NAD-seq. Subjecting Arabidopsis RNA to both the original NAD captureSeq and SPAAC-NAD-seq, we found that more NAD+-capped RNA was identified by the latter, particularly those with low abundance. This led to the discovery of new gene ontology terms such as starch biosynthsis, intracellular protein transport and response to cadmium stress associated with genes that produce NAD-RNA. Furthermore, reads were uniformly distributed along gene bodies, which suggested that SPAAC-NAD-seq retained full-length sequence information. SPAAC-NAD-seq enables specific and efficient discovery of NAD-RNA in prokaryotes, and when combined with m7G-RNA depletion, in eukaryotes.

PRJNA681622	The SNF2 ATPase-independent function of the INO80 chromatin remodeler [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"In the multi-subunit INO80 chromatin-remodeling complex, all the auxiliary subunits assemble on three distinct domains of the catalytic chromatin remodeler INO80, which are N-terminal domain, HSA domain, and ATPase domain. While the ATPase and HSA domains and the auxiliary subunits assembling on the domains are known to be responsible for ATP hydrolysis and chromatin remodeling, it is largely unknown how the auxiliary subunits assembling on the INO80 N-terminal domain regulate the chromatin status. We identify both conserved and non-conserved auxiliary subunits of the INO80 complex in Arabidopsis thaliana. All the auxiliary subunits assemble on the conserved N-terminal domain, HSA domain, and ATPase domain of INO80 in Arabidopsis. While the auxiliary subunits assembling on the INO80 ATPase domain are required for the ATPase-dependent function, the INO80 N-terminal domain and the auxiliary subunits assembling on the domain can regulate gene expression and development even when the ATPase domain is absent, suggesting that INO80 has an ATPase-independent role. Furthermore, we find that a subclass of the COMPASS histone H3K4 methyltransferase complexes assemble on the INO80 N-terminal domain in the INO80 complex and function together with the other auxiliary subunits assembling on the INO80 N-terminal domain, thereby facilitating the ATPase-independent function. This study suggests that the conserved chromatin remodeler INO80 has an ATPase-independent role and demonstrates that the auxiliary subunits assembling on the INO80 N-terminal domain are required for the ATPase-independent role.

PRJNA681862	Heteromeric HSFA2/HSFA3 complexes drive transcriptional memory after heat stress in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Adaptive plasticity in stress responses is a key element of plant survival strategies. For instance, moderate heat stress (HS) primes a plant to acquire thermotolerance, which allows subsequent survival of more severe HS conditions. Acquired thermotolerance is actively maintained over several days (HS memory) and involves the sustained induction of memory-related genes. We find FORGETTER3/ HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR A3 (FGT3/HSFA3) to be specifically required for physiological HS memory and maintaining high memory-gene expression during the days following a HS exposure. HSFA3 mediates HS memory by direct transcriptional activation of memory-related genes after return to normal growth temperatures. HSFA3 binds HSFA2, and in vivo both proteins form heteromeric complexes with additional HSFs. Our results indicate that only complexes containing both HSFA2 and HSFA3 efficiently promote transcriptional memory by promoting histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) hyper-methylation. In summary, our work defines the major HSF complex controlling transcriptional memory and elucidates the in vivo dynamics of HSF complexes during somatic stress memory.

The first and the second stress treatment was seperated by 5 days long lag-phase, which is long enough to reset most of the primary stress response. Several early light and early cold responsive genes showed however a altered transcript abundance in plants, which received five days befor the cold priming stimulus. Espicially JA responsive genes showed a common priming regulation within the cold and light exposure.
Overall design: Transcript levels were assessed in a transcriptome wide scale by peired end next generation sequencing (BGI-Seq-500).

How the MG cell/VC fate is determined remains largely unknown. Here, we report that the VC-targeted H3K27me3 erasure resulted in VC fate transition towards a gamete destination. Multi-omics and cytologic analysis reveal that H3K27me3 is essential for VC fate commitment and contributes to suppress the MG cell fate initiation in VC, whereas MG cells require H3K27me3 reprograming for the gamete cell fate. This work suggests that the MG cell/VC fate is epigenetically regulated. The dimorphic H3K27 methylation acts as a core switch to determine their distinct cell fates and ensure the functional specification of both VC and MG for pollen fertility. This work also provides direct evidences for the proposal that VC maintains the default developmental program of microspore, whereas MG requires reprogramming.

Methods: mRNA was extracted from non-treated and silver nanoparticle-treated 14-day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using the RNAeasy extraction kit (Qiagen). RNA-seq libraries (3 rep/treatment and 3 reps/control) constructed with the TruSeq Stranded mRNA Sample Preparation kit (Illumina) were single-end sequenced (100-nt read length) on an Illumina HiSeq2500 system.

Results: Chronic exposure of A. thaliana plants to silver nanoparticles caused a change in abundance of transcripts involved in cell wall synhtesis and response to oxidative and biotic stress-related genes.
Conclusions: While exposure to silver nanoparticle lead to gene expression changes, the reduction in chlorophyll concentration and carbon assimilation rate measured in exposed plants cannot be attributed to a shift in photosynthesis-related gene regulation.

Here, we show that two DEK proteins, DEK3 and DEK4, redundantly control the floral transition in Arabidopsis. DEK3 and DEK4 directly associate with chromatin of related flowering repressors, FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), and its two homologs, MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) and MAF5, to promote their expression.
The binding of DEK3 and DEK4 to histone octamer in vivo affects histone modifications at FLC, MAF4 and MAF5 loci. In addition, DEK3 and DEK4 interact with RNA polymerase II and promote the association of RNA polymerase II with FLC, MAF4 and MAF5 chromatin to promote their expression.
Our results show that DEK3 and DEK4 directly interact with chromatin to facilitate the transcription of key flowering repressors and thus prevent precocious flowering in Arabidopsis.
Overall design: 7-day-old seedlings of Col-0, dek3-2, dek4-2, and dd-2 were examined with RNA-Seq to identify differentially expressed genes caused by DEK3 and DEK4 mutation in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA687748	Genome-wide identification of RNA-chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"It is increasingly evident that various RNA molecules can bind chromatin to regulate gene expression and genome organization. Here we adapted a sequencing-based technique to profile RNA-chromatin interactions at a genome-wide scale in Arabidopsis seedlings. We identified more than ten thousand RNA-chromatin interactions mediated by protein-coding RNAs, long non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) and small ncRNAs in Arabidopsis. These RNAs preferentially target genic regions, especially exonic regions. Protein-coding RNAs primarily engage in local and cis-chromosomal interactions, whereas long ncRNAs (lncRNAs) and small ncRNAs preferentially engage in trans-chromosomal interactions. RNA-chromatin interactions tend to positively correlate with DNA-DNA interactions, suggesting a role of DNA-DNA interactions in confining RNA-chromatin interactions and/or a role of RNA-chromatin interactions in shaping genome organization at a global level. We further show that some RNA-chromatin interactions undergo alterations in response to biotic and abiotic stresses. Our study provides a global view of RNA-chromatin interactions in Arabidopsis and a rich resource for future investigation of the regulatory roles of RNAs in gene expression and genome organization.
Overall design: To identify chromatin-associated RNAs and their target sites in Arabidopsis, we conducted GRID-seq using Arabidopsis wild-type Col-0 seedlings. To evaluate the contribution of RNA transcription level to the abundance of RNAs detected in GRID-seq, we conducted global nuclear run-on sequencing (Gro-seq) to detect the levels of nascent RNAs and compared RNA reads in GRID-seq and Gro-seq. To determine the overlap between RNA-chromatin interactions and DNA-DNA interactions, we conducted BL-Hi-C and compared interactions identified by GRID-seq and BL-Hi-C. To determine whether RNA-chromatin interactions are dynamic and respond to environmental cues, we conducted GRID-seq using heat-treated and DC3000-treated seedlings. Less..."

PRJNA689568	The DME demethylase regulates sporophyte gene expression, cell proliferation, differentiation, and meristem resurrection (thale cress)	"The flowering plant life cycle consists of alternating haploid (gametophyte) and diploid (sporophyte) generations, where the sporophytic generation begins with fertilization of haploid gametes. In Arabidopsis, genome-wide DNA demethylation is required for normal development, catalyzed by the DEMETER (DME) DNA demethylase in the gamete companion cells of male and female gametophytes. In the sporophyte, postembryonic growth and development are largely dependent on the activity of numerous stem cell niches, or meristems. Analyzing Arabidopsis plants homozygous for a loss-of-function dme-2 allele, we show that DME influences many aspects of sporophytic growth and development. dme-2 mutants exhibited delayed seed germination, variable root hair growth, aberrant cellular proliferation and differentiation followed by enhanced de novo shoot formation, dysregulation of root quiescence and stomatal precursor cells, and inflorescence meristem (IM) resurrection. We also show that sporophytic DME activity exerts a profound effect on the transcriptome of developing Arabidopsis plants, including discrete groups of regulatory genes that are misregulated in dme-2 mutant tissues, allowing us to potentially link phenotypes to changes in specific gene expression pathways. These results show that DME plays a key role in sporophytic development and suggest that DME-mediated active DNA demethylation may be involved in the maintenance of stem cell activities during the sporophytic life cycle in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA689878	RNA-seq analysis of WT and bdt1 in Arabidopsis. (thale cress)	"Trimethylated histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is a repressive histone marker that regulates a variety of developmental processes, including those that determine flowering time. However, relatively little is known about the mechanism of how H3K27me3 is recognized to regulate transcription. We identified BAH domain-containing transcriptional regulator 1 (BDT1) as an H3K27me3 reader. BDT1 is responsible for preventing flowering by suppressing the expression of flowering genes. Mutation of the H3K27me3 recognition sites in the BAH domain disrupted the binding of BDT1 to H3K27me3, leading to de-repression of H3K27me3-enriched flowering genes and an early-flowering phenotype.

PRJNA648851	DET1-mediated COP1 regulation avoids HY5 activity over second-site targets to tune plant photomorphogenesis (thale cress)	"DE-ETIOLATED1 (DET1) is a negative regulator of plant photomorphogenesis acting as a component of the C3D complex, which can further associate to CULLIN4 to form a CRL4C3D E3 ubiquitin ligase. CRL4C3D is thought to act together with CRL4COP1SPA ubiquitin ligase, to promote the ubiquitin-mediated degradation of the master regulatory transcription factor ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5), thereby controlling photomorphogenic gene regulatory networks. Yet, functional links between COP1 and DET1 have long remained elusive. Here, upon mass spectrometry identification of DET1 and COP1-associated proteins, we provide in vivo evidence that DET1 associates with COP1 to promote its destabilization, a process necessary to dampen HY5 protein abundance. By regulating HY5 over-accumulation, DET1 is critical to avoid its association to second-site loci, including many PIF3 target genes. Accordingly, excessive HY5 levels result in an increased HY5 repressive activity and are sufficient to trigger fusca-like phenotypes otherwise observed typically in COP1 and COP9 signalosome mutant seedlings. This study therefore identifies that DET1-mediated regulation of COP1 stability tunes down HY5 cistrome and avoids hyper-photomorphogenic responses that might compromise plant viability.

PRJNA691022	Title:  Leaf transcriptomics  of Catalan A. thaliana demes under alkaline and carbonated stress at 3h and 48 hours. (thale cress)	"Purpose: High carbonate and bicarbonate concentrations of calcareous soils with high pH can affect crop  performance due to different constraints. The goal of this study is to perform a comparative transcriptomic analysis using demes moderate-tolerance and sensitive under alkaline stress ( high pH 8.3 and  10 mM NaHCO3)
Methods: Transcriptomic analysis was performed on two naturally selected Arabidopsis thaliana demes. Carbon soil tolerant A1(c+) and the sensitive T6(c-). Plants 15 day-old were exposed for 3 or 48 h to either pH stress alone (pH 5.9 vs pH 8.3 adjusted by BTP and MES buffers) or to alkaline stress (pH 8.3) caused by 10 mM of
Results Shoot transcriptome analysis revealed that bicarbonate quickly (3 h) induced Fe-deficiency related genes in T6(c-) leaves, while in A1 (c+) main initial changes were found in receptor-like proteins (RPL), jasmonate (JA) and salicylate (SA) pathways, methionine-derived glucosinolate (GS), Sulphur starvation, starch degradation, and cell cycle.
Conclusions:  Our results suggest that leaves of carbonate tolerant plants do not sense iron deficiency as fast as sensitive ones.  This is in line with the ability to translocate more iron to aerial parts, producing a higher biomass and maintaining silique production. In leaves of A1(c+) plants, the activation of other genes related to apoplastic stress perception, signal transduction, GS, sulphur acquisition, and cell cycle regu-lation precedes the induction of iron homeostasis mechanisms yielding an efficient response to bicarbonate stress

PRJNA691879	Histone demethylases ELF6 and JMJ13 antagonistically regulate self-fertility in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The chromatin modification H3K27me3 is involved in almost every developmental stage in  Arabidopsis. Much remains unknown about the dynamic regulation of this histone modification in flower development and control of self-fertility. Here we demonstrate that the H3K27me3-specific demethylases ELF6 and JMJ13 antagonistically regulate carpel and stamen growth and thus modulate self-fertility. Transcriptome and epigenome data are used to identify potential targets of ELF6 and JMJ13 responsible for these physiological functions. We find that ELF6 relieves expansin genes of epigenetic silencing to promote cell elongation in the carpel, enhancing carpel growth and therefore encouraging out-crossing. On the other hand, JMJ13 activates genes of the jasmonic acid regulatory network alongside the auxin responsive SAUR26, to inhibit carpel growth, enhance stamen growth, and overall promote self-pollination. Our evidence provides novel mechanisms of self-fertility regulation in A.thaliana demonstrating how chromatin modifying enzymes govern the equilibrium between flower self-pollination and out-crossing.

PRJNA692747	The CLASSY family controls tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"DNA methylation alters the epigenetic landscape of the genome, plays critical roles in regulating gene expression, and ensures transposon silencing. As evidenced by the numerous defects associated with aberrant DNA methylation landscapes, establishing proper tissue-specific methylation patterns is critical. Yet, how such differences arise remains a largely open question in both plants and animals. Here we demonstrate that four CLASSY proteins (CLSY1-4), which are differentially expressed during plant development, play major roles in controlling tissue-specific DNA methylation patterns. Depending on the tissue, the genetic requirements for specific CLSYs differ significantly and on a global scale, certain clsy mutants are sufficient to largely shift the epigenetic landscape between tissues. Together, these findings not only reveal substantial epigenetic diversity between tissues, but assign these changes to specific CLSY proteins, revealing how locus-specific targeting combined with tissue-specific expression enables the CLSYs to generate epigenetic diversity during plant development.

PRJNA606046	The m6A reader CPSF30-L regulates alternative polyadenylation affecting nitrate signaling in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"As the most ubiquitous internal modification of eukaryotic mRNA, m6A (N6-methyladenosine) modification plays a vital role in almost every aspect of mRNA metabolism. However, the evidence of m6A in regulating the alternative polyadenylation (APA) is limited. APA is controlled by a large protein-RNA complex with many components including CPSF30. Arabidopsis CPSF30 has two isoforms, the longer one named CPSF30-L containing an additional YTH (YT512-B Homology)-domain in the C terminus, which is unique in plant. In this study, we revealed that m6A modification directly regulated APA, by proving the capability of Arabidopsis CPSF30-L YTH domain binding to m6A substrate by using in vitro assay and structural studies. We observed that extensive genes shifted their poly(A) sites in cpsf30-2 and found that numerous genes altered polyadenylation site (PAS) that correlated well with previously identified m6A peaks, indicating that genes carry m6A modification are prone to be regulated by APA. Moreover, we found that several important genes involved in nitrate metabolism are amongst those genes with APA site alteration in cpsf30-2.And we could rescue these APA and nitrate metabolism defects by introducing the wild-type CPSF30-L, but not by m6A-binding defective mutants (W259A, W310A or Y319A), which explained the nitrogen signaling defects of cpsf30-2 discovered previously. Taken together, our results demonstrated that m6A modification could directly regulate APA in Arabidopsis and revealed the function of m6A reader CPSF30-L in nitrate signaling by controlling APA regulation. This study will shed new lights on the roles of m6A modification during RNA 3’-end processing in plant development.

PRJNA694619	Involvement of UBA2C in ambient temperature-dependent flowering by promoting FLM transcription [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Ambient temperature dependent flowering time is an important feature that is required for plants to reproduce in various environmental conditions. The rising global temperature poses a significant challenge to the growth and reproduction of plants. In Arabidopsis thaliana, FLM-β, a major splicing isoform of the flowering repressor gene FLOWERING LOCUS M, is down-regulated in response to increasing temperature and represents a critical mechanism for plants to respond to temperature changes. However, it is unknown how the transcript level of FLM-β is down-regulated. Here we identify an RRM domain-containing protein, UBA2C, as a previously uncharacterized flowering repressor by forward genetic screening. We demonstrate that UBA2C directly binds to FLM chromatin and facilitates FLM transcription predominantly by inhibiting the histone H3K27 trimethylation, a histone mark related to transcriptional repression. At FLM chromatin, the histone H3K27 trimethylation is enhanced in response to increasing temperatures. Depletion of UBA2C weakens the response of FLM transcription and H3K27 trimethylation to temperature changes. UBA2C forms multiple puncta in the nucleus and the number of puncta increases with increasing temperatures. UBA2C contains a prion-like domain (PrLD) that is responsible for forming puncta in the nucleus in vivo. These results not only identify a previously unknown flowering-time regulator but also reveal the mechanism by which the regulator controls flowering time in response to temperature changes.

Here we explored those changes in Arabidopsis thaliana plants subjected to multiple biotic and abiotic stresses, and identified transposable element (TE) activation in plants infested with the green peach aphid, Myzus persicae. We performed a genome-wide analysis of DNA methylation, mRNA expression, mRNA degradation and small RNAs accumulation. Our results demonstrate that aphid feeding induces loss of methylation of hundreds of loci, mainly TEs with labile chromatin characteristics. This loss of methylation has the potential to regulate gene expression and we found evidence that it is involved in the control of key plant immunity genes. Accordingly, we find that mutant plants deficient in epigenetic silencing show increased resistance to M.persicae infestation. Collectively, our results show that changes in DNA methylation play a significant role in the regulation of the plant transcriptional response and induction of defence response against aphid feeding.

These converted loci are enriched at the edge regions of long transposable elements (TEs). Furthermore, we found that blocking the pathway switch by disrupting both DDM1 and RdDM causes strong reactivation of TEs and a burst of TE transposition in the first generation of mutant plants, indicating that the pathway conversion is critical to maintaining TE repression and protecting genomic stability. Our findings reveal the existence of a novel pathway conversion-based backup mechanism to guarantee the maintenance of DNA methylation and genome integrity. Less...

PRJDB8980	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Mechanosensation of raindrops via trichome hair-like cells evokes plant immune response	Raindrops are known to contain bacteria, fungi, and virus, and thus we hypothesized that plants may perceive raindrops as the emergency signal. However, if and how plants respond to raindrops is totally unknown. Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis leaves demonstrated that artificial raindrops unambiguously express genes related to disease resistance via mechanical stress. Genetic and bioimaging studies revealed that the mechanical stress induces Ca2+ waves and the expression of immune gene concentrically around trichomes. Furthermore, our results indicate that a member of the calmodulin binding transcription activator (CAMTA) is involved in the transcriptional changes induced by raindrops. We confirmed that trichome-mediated immunity significantly reduces the growth of virulent Pseudomonas syringae, concluding that trichomes are the sensors of mechano-stimuli to initiate the earliest layer of plant immunity.

PRJEB38730	ApocaroRootsComparison of wild-type and carotenoid accumulating Arabidopsis roots	The amount of carotenoids in plant tissues is the net result of the rate of biosynthesis and degradation. While the complex network of enzymes involved in biosynthesis was extensively characterized in recent years, knowledge on oxidative carotenoid degradation, which is predominantly initiated by non-enzymatic rather than enzymatic cleavage into apocarotenoids, is sparse. Moreover, subsequent metabolism of the formed apocarotenoids has so far only been characterized for apocarotenoids being precursors of carotenoid-derived plant hormones, but remains unknown for the majority of apocarotenoids. Notably, non-enzymatic carotenoid degradation generates substantial losses of nutritionally important carotenoids such as provitamin A carotenoids, zeaxanthin and lutein in many crops, fruits and vegetables. In order to identify novel processes involved in apocarotenoid metabolization in plants, we characterized the transcriptomic response of Arabidopsis roots accumulating high levels of β-carotene and β-apocarotenoids due to overexpression of the rate-limiting carotenogenic enzyme phytoene synthase. Transcriptome analysis revealed feedback regulation on carotenoid biosynthesis aiming at reducing the amount of β-carotene, which might suggest involvement of specific apocarotenoid signaling molecules originating directly from β-carotene degradation. Moreover, the transcriptome response showed a large overlap with detoxification responses observed upon plant treatment with xenobiotics and fatty acid-derived reactive carbonyl species (RCS). Notably, metabolite analysis revealed that the response was not due to lipid stress, a potential secondary effect of carotenoid accumulation, and is therefore distinct from an RCS response. Nonetheless, a set of known RCS detoxification enzymes was found to be induced as part of the response. In agreement with structural similarities between RCS and β-apocarotenoids, the latter representing reactive electrophile species (RES), we report for the first time that RCS detoxification enzymes are also capable of converting apocarotenoids derived from β-carotene and xanthophylls into apocarotenols and apocarotenoic acids in vitro. Moreover, several glutathione-S transferases, glycosyltransferases and transporters were induced in carotenoid-accumulating Arabidopsis roots. In view of similarities to mechanisms found in crocin biosynthesis in Crocus sativus and RCS metabolism in plants, our data might suggest glycosylation, glutathionylation and compartmentalization as key processes in (apo)carotenoid metabolism in plants and open the way to further investigations in this field.

PRJEB39290	Cell-type specific epigenetic de-repression of the transcription factor ZAT6 establishes a spatially delimited transcriptional network in Arabidopsis roots	Gene function in multicellular organisms is intimately linked to location. Gene expression atlases of plant tissues based on single-cell transcriptomics have provided an essential resource for predicting gene function. However, regulatory networks within cell-type specific gene-sets remain to be unravelled. The cell layers surrounding the xylem vessels in mature roots occupy a strategically important position for controlling root-to-shoot transport and signalling, and their function relies on cell-type specific expression of enzymes and transporters. We generated a pHKT1-NTF Arabidopsis line to analyse transcripts and epigentic marks in this location using FACS RNA- and INTACT ChIP-sequencing. Here we show that several thousand genes are preferentially expressed in the tagged cell types. Less than a hundred display a location-specific decrease in H3K27me3, but they are statistically diagnostic for the tissue and strongly enriched for transcription factors. In addition to regulating key embryonic genes during cell differentiation, H3K27me3 might therefore determine cell-type specific transcriptomes in mature tissues by de-repressing a small core-set of transcription factors. As a proof of principle, we show that one of the cell-type specific H3K27me3-depleted transcription factors, ZAT6, regulates over a hundred downstream genes, enriched for ethylene and oxylipin-signalling pathways. The ZAT6-regulome is cell-type delimited and depends on the histone demethylase REF6, which removes H3K27me3 from ZAT6. Our findings pave the way for bottom-up deconstruction of regulatory cascades in a crucial location within the plant vasculature. Less...	
PRJEB34363	Crosstalk between DNA methylation, DNA compaction and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 through an analysis of Arabidopsis ddm1 clf mutants	In plants and many organisms, DNA methylation is a hallmark of transposable elements (TE) that negatively controls TE expression. On the other hand, histone H3 lysine 27 trimethylation (H3K27me3), deposited by the highly conserved Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2), is a hallmark of transcriptional repression associated with protein-coding and miRNA genes. Nevertheless, there is a growing body of evidence for functional interplay between these pathways. In particular, many TE sequences, upon their loss of DNA methylation, display H3K27me3 marks and this suggests that PcG could serve as a back-up silencing system for hypomethylated TEs. Here, we show that in ddm1 mutants impaired for DNA methylation, hundreds of TEs gain H3K27m3 as previously observed for met1, and that this gain is completely dependent on the PRC2-SET domain protein CURLY LEAF (CLF), with no redundancy of its paralog SWINGER (SWN). Unexpectedly, complete loss of H3K27me3 in ddm1 clf was not associated with further reactivation of TE expression in ddm1 clf as compared to ddm1, nor with a burst of transposition with the notable exception of the ATCOPIA93 retroelement EVD. Instead, ddm1 clf globally exhibited a partial suppression of ddm1 molecular phenotypes with a partial recompaction of DNA coupled with DNA remethylation. Thus, H3K27me3 marks antagonize DNA remethylation and condensation in a ddm1 background. These findings bring valuable information on the mode of PRC2 action and have potential implications for TE control in naturally hypomethylated cell-types such as the pollen vegetative cell or the endosperm, or after their transposition.

PRJEB41301	Plant vacuole sRNAsDifferential degradation of RNA species by autophagy related pathways in plants	An important function of the plant vacuole is the recycling of delivered proteins and RNA by autophagy. We provide the first plant vacuolar small RNome by isolation of intact vacuoles from Arabidopsis plants, subsequent RNA purification and Next Generation Sequencing. In these vacuolar sRNomes, all types of cellular RNAs were found including those of chloroplast origin, suggesting a bulk-type of RNA transfer to, and breakdown in vacuoles. ATG5 is a major representative of autophagy genes and we observed that the vacuolar RNA composition in corresponding knockout plants (atg5-1) differed clearly from controls as most chloroplast derived RNA species were missing. Moreover, the read length distribution of RNAs found in atg5-1 differed to control samples, indicating altered RNA processing. In contrast, vacuolar RNA length and composition of plants lacking the vacuolar RNase2 (rns2-2), involved in cellular RNA homeostasis, showed minor alterations, only. Our data therefore suggests that mainly autophagy components are responsible for selective transport and targeting of different RNA species into the vacuole for degradation. In addition, mature miRNAs were detected in all vacuolar preparations, however in atg5-1 at much lower frequency, indicating a new biological role for vacuolar miRNAs apart from becoming degraded.

Therefore, sequencing of hen2-2 mutants reveals a rich diversity of novel transcripts. We have performed nanopore direct RNA sequencing of the hen2-2 mutant using a single minION flow cell, to test the ability of our two-pass alignment method to detect novel genuine splice junctions in a well-annotated organism under poorly annotated conditions.

Large numbers of nucleotide-binding, leucine-rich repeat receptor genes (NLRs) are found in plant genomes and provide disease resistance. However, NLRs can trigger autoimmunity, disrupt beneficial microbiota or reduce fitness. It is therefore crucial to understand how NLRs are controlled.

Using long-read nanopore direct RNA sequencing we resolved the complexity of NLR transcript processing and gene annotation.

PRJEB41651	RNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with Flg22 or Pep1	In this research a high-throughput RNA sequencing based transcriptome analysis technique (RNA-Seq) was used to evaluate differentially expressed genes (DEGs) in the wild type Arabidopsis seedling in response to flg22, a well-known microbe-associated molecular patterns (MAMP), and AtPep1, a well-known peptide representing an endogenous damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMP). The results of our study revealed that 1895 (1634 up-regulated and 261 down-regulated) and 2271 (1706 up-regulated and 565 down-regulated) significant differentially expressed genes in response to flg22 and AtPep1 treatment, respectively. Among significant DEGs, we observed that a number of hitherto overlooked genes have been found to be induced upon treatment with either flg22 or with AtPep1, indicating their possible involvement in innate immunity. Here, we characterized two of them, namely PP2-B13 and ACLP1. PP2-B13 contains an F-box domain and shows similarity to carbohydrate binding proteins. ACLP1 is a protein of unknown function with highest similarity to actin cross linking proteins and includes a fascin domain. Using qPCR, we verified that the genes encoding PP2-B13, and ACLP1 were highly induced upon treatment of leaf disks with flg22. We obtained T-DNA insertion mutants and generated homozygous mutant lines. None of the mutants showed a phenotype in the absence of infection. pp2-b13 and aclp1 mutants showed an increased susceptibility to infection by the virulent pathogen Pseudomomas syringae pv tomato mutant hrcC-, as evidenced by an increased growth of the pathogen in planta. Further we present evidence that aclp1 was deficient in ethylene production upon flg22 treatment, while pp2-b13, was deficient in ROS production. In conclusion, the products of these genes contribute to plant immunity against bacterial pathogens, although there is currently no clue for their mechanism of action. The results from this research provide new information to a better understanding of the immune system in Arabidopsis. Less...

To label meiotic nuclei we used the promoter of AtDMC1 recombinase. AtDMC1-driven expression of biotin-labeled NTF allowed us to collect meiocyte nuclei using streptavidin-coated magnetic beads. Expression of known meiotic genes was evidenced by RNA-seq analysis.

PRJNA666009	Effects of ATSU4 on root development under high sucrose stress	Sucrose is the principal product of photosynthesis used for the distribution of assimilated carbon in plants. Source-to-sink transport of sucrose is one of the major determinants of plant growth. However, the role of AtSUC4, a member of sucrose transporter family, was undervalued in this process due to its weak expression in sink organ during seedling. In our study, the root of atsuc4 knockout lines accumulated less sucrose compared with wild-type (WT) plants with the 4% and 6% sucrose supplementation. Meanwhile, the main root length of the mutants was significantly longer than that of the WT, including the meristem region. While, this phenotype could not be imitated by external application of glucose or mannitol. In addition, comparative transcriptome between WT and atsuc4 mutant showed that the pathways of sucrose transport, synthesis and degradation, T6P signals, ABA signals and auxin signals were significantly changed. Taken together, we conclude that the deficiency of AtSUC4, on the one hand, reduces the uptake of sucrose, on the other hand, as a signal, was involved in plant response to high sucrose stress.

PRJNA682418	Complex-Type N-Glycans Influence the Root Hair Landscape of Arabidopsis Seedlings by Altering the Auxin Output	Roots supply plants with nutrients and water, besides anchoring them in the soil. The primary root with its lateral roots constitutes the central skeleton of the root system. In particular, root hairs increase the root surface, which is critical for optimizing uptake efficiency. During root-cell growth and development, many proteins that are components of, e.g., the cell wall and plasma membrane are constitutively transported through the secretory system and become posttranslationally modified. Here, the best-studied posttranslational modification is protein N-glycosylation. While alterations in the attachment/modification of N-glycans within the ER lumen results in severe developmental defects, the impact of Golgi-localized complex N-glycan modification, particularly on root development, has not been studied in detail. We report that impairment of complex-type N-glycosylation results in a differential response to synthetic phytohormones with earlierand increased root-hair elongation. Application of either the cytokinin BAP, the auxin NAA,or the ethylene precursor ACC revealed an interaction of auxin with complex N-glycosylationduring root-hair development. Especially in gntI mutant seedlings, the early block ofcomplex N-glycan formation resulted in an increased auxin sensitivity. RNA-seq experiments suggest that gntI roots have permanently elevated nutrient-, hypoxia-, and defense-stressresponses, which might be a consequence of the altered auxin responsiveness. Less...

PRJNA680434	RNA-seq analysis of Arabidopsis clb19 mutants expressing synthetic editing factors	Targeted cytidine to uridine RNA editing is a widespread phenomenon throughout the land plant lineage. Members of the pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) protein family act as the specificity factors in this process. The huge expansion of the PPR superfamily in land plants provides the sequence variation required for design of novel consensus-based RNA-binding proteins. We used this approach to construct a synthetic RNA editing factor designed to target one of the two sites in the Arabidopsis chloroplast transcriptome naturally recognised by the RNA editing factor CHLOROPLAST BIOGENESIS 19 (CLB19). We show that this designed editing factor can partially complement a clb19 mutant. The designed factor is specific for the target rpoA site and does not recognise or edit the other site recognised by CLB19 in the clpP1 transcript. This study serves as a successful pilot into the design and application of programmable RNA editing factors based on plant PPR proteins. Less...

PRJNA689701	A bacterial effector uncovers a metabolic pathway involved in resistance to bacterial wilt disease	Bacterial wilt caused by the soil-borne pathogen Ralstonia solanacearum is a devastating disease worldwide. Upon plant colonization, R. solanacearum replicates massively, causing plant wilting and death; collapsed infected tissues then serve as a source of inoculum. In this work, we show that the plant metabolic pathway mediated by pyruvate decarboxylases (PDCs), activated in response to low oxygen and involved in drought stress tolerance, contributes to resistance against bacterial wilt disease. Arabidopsis and tomato respond to R. solanacearum infection by increasing PDC activity, and plants with deficient PDC activity are more susceptible to bacterial wilt. Treatment with either pyruvic acid or acetic acid (substrate and product of the PDC pathway, respectively) enhances resistance to bacterial wilt, and, as it was reported for drought stress tolerance, acetic acid-induced resistance to bacterial wilt seems to be associated with the phytohormone jasmonic acid. This work reveals a metabolic pathway involved in resistance to biotic and abiotic stresses, and a bacterial virulence strategy to promote disease and the completion of the pathogenic life cycle.

PRJNA640858	Cis-regulatory evolution spotlights species differences in the adaptive potential of plant transcriptional plasticity	Phenotypic plasticity is the variation in phenotype that a single genotype can produce in different environments and, as such, is an important component of individual fitness. However, whether the effect of new mutations, and hence evolution, depends on the direction of plasticity remains controversial. Here, we identify the cis-acting modifications that have reshaped the response of the transcriptome to dehydration stress with a time course in three Arabidopsis species. Seeds of A. thaliana accession Col-0 and Arabidopsis lyrata ssp. lyrata genotype MN47 were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC, USA). Seeds of A. halleri h2-2 (Gorno, Italy) were obtained from Pierre Saumitou-Laprade (University of Lille, France). F1 crosses were generated by pollinating emasculated A. thaliana flowers with pollen of A. lyrata (AthxAly) or A. halleri (AthxAhal), as described in de Meaux et al. (2006). Crosses with A. thaliana as the pollen parent were unsuccessful and thus no reciprocal F1s were included. Col-0, MN47, AthxAly and AthxAha F1 hybrids were germinated and grown on germination medium containing Murashige and Skoog salts, 1% sucrose, and 0.8% agar. The plants were stratified for 3 days at 4 degree, and then transferred to soil. Plants were grown for 4 weeks. A. halleri plants were multiplied by clonal amplification and grown for three weeks. Plants were all randomly placed and grown in a chamber at 20 degree under 14 h light, 16 degree 10 h dark under dim light (100 mmol). Dehydration treatment was applied in four independent trials performed at one-week intervals and followed a published protocol. Germination or cuttings were staggered over four weeks to ensure that plant size at harvest was comparable across the four trials. For the dehydration treatment, the aerial part of the plants was cut at the base of the roots to mimic a rupture of the water column, as occurs when the plant wilts, and deposited on absorbent paper for 0, 1.5, 3, 6, 12 and 24 hours in the growth chamber under the same growth conditions. The whole aerial part of parental or hybrid individuals was flash frozen in Eppendorf tubes using liquid nitrogen and homogenized to fine powder in a Homogenizer of Precellys Evolution (Bertin Technologies). Total RNA was extracted in 1 ml of Invitrogen TRIzol Plus RNA Purification System (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and decontaminated with the DNA-free kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific). RNA quality and quantity were examined with the Bioanalyzer 2100 (Agilent) and Qubit 2.0 Fluorometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). Two microgram of Total RNA was used for library preparation. Library preparation followed the TruSeq Illumina RNA Sample Preparation v2 Guide. Sequencing was performed on Illumina HiSeq2000 following the manufacturer's protocols, and paired-end 100 bp long reads were obtained. Less...	
PRJNA632576	Arabidopsis thaliana NOR2 sequencing	Despite vast differences between organisms, some characteristics of their genomes are conserved, such as the nucleolus organizing region (NOR). The NOR is constituted of multiple, highly repetitive rDNA genes, encoding the catalytic ribosomal core RNAs which are transcribed from 45S rDNA units. Their precise sequence information and organization remained un-characterized.We used long read in combination with short read sequencing to assemble contigs of the Arabidopsis NOR 2 rDNA domain providing a first scaffold . We identified several expressed rRNA gene variants which are integrated into translating ribosomes in a tissue specific manner. These findings led to the concept of tissue specific ribosome subpopulations differing in their rRNA composition. Less...

PRJNA561194	Arabidopsis thaliana, Oryza Sativa, japonicaDiscovery and function of RNA G-quadruplex structures in plants	Emerging evidence shows the importance of RNA G-quadruplex (RG4) structures in regulating gene expression. However, the in vivo folding status of RG4s in eukaryotes has been controversial. Here, we investigate RG4 existence and function in plants. By combining in vitro and in vivo RNA structure chemical profiling methods with immunofluorescence analysis, we discovered hundreds of RG4s folded in plants. Notably, the in vivo folding status of RG4s were remarkably enhanced and induced in response to cold. Using genetic and physiological validations, we found that plants with disrupted RG4s displayed both root developmental changes and insensitivity to cold. Thus, for the first time, our work reveals the existence of RG4s in plants and that plants adopt folded RG4 structures in regulating development and temperature response. Less...

MYB75 is a major regulator to regulate the biosynthesis of anthocyanin in Arabidopsis during multiple stress environment including salt stress. However, the mechanism of MYB75 regulating anthocyanin synthesis under salt stress is not yet clear. Our study illustrated that ECAP act as a transcriptional repressor, which could directly interact with MYB75 and inhibit the transcriptional activity of MBW complex. Further study showed that salt stress released the activity of MYB75 by degrading the ECAP though 26S proteasome pathway. Furthermore, we found ECAP played a negatively role in both JA-dependent and JA-independent anthocyanin biosynthesis during the salt stress. Our research elucidates the mechanism of the ECAP-MYB75 pathway involved in the synthesis of anthocyanin induced by salt stress. Less...

PRJNA635263	RNA-sequencing of Arabidopsis rrp1-3 mutants, RRP1-overexpressing line and wild type plants	Abscisic acid (ABA) plays important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development, as well as various stress adaptation. Although much progress has been made toward understanding the molecular mechanisms for ABA homoeostasis and signaling, how plant cells integrate ABA trafficking and signaling to regulate plant developmental processes is poorly understood. Manipulation of AtRRP1 expression affects ABA sensitivity in seed germination and seedling growth, as well as several ABA transporter gene transcripts and ABA contents. To overall understand Arabidopsis RRP1-regulated genes in the transgenic plants, three groups including the rrp1-3 mutants (homozygote gained by CRISPR) and the RRP1-overexpressing line (Super: RRP1-3) and the wild type plants (WT) was used for RNA-sequencing (RNA-seq).

PRJNA632895	Identification of genes regulated by the MADS transcription factor (TF), SEPALLATA3, in the context of the double sep1sep2 and triple sep1sep2sep3 mutant background, by RNA-Seq analysis (thale cress)	"These analyses allowed the identification of more than 2000 genes regulated by the MADS TF, SEPALLATA3 (SEP3). Although the involvement of SEP3 in all flower organ development is well established,  the single sep3  mutant shows no flower phenotype, due to redundancy with other SEPALLATA genes. The triple mutant, sep1sep2sep3, shows no floral organ development except sepals, while the sep1sep2 mutant showed characteristic WT flower with, from the outer to the inner whorl of the flower, 4 sepals, 4 petals, 6 stamens and one gynoecium. We performed RNA-seq analysis on sep1sep2, sep1sep2sep3 and on sep1sep2sep3 lines complemented with SEP3 to highlight genes involved in floral organ development and controlled by SEP3. For this purpose we compared gene expression between the triple and the double mutant, and between triple mutant lines complemented with SEP3 and the triple mutant.  Genes were considered regulated by SEP3 when the log FC was between 1 and -1 and the FDR <0.05. Using these criteria, we obtained a list of  >2000 genes regulated by SEP3.
Overall design: RNA seq analysis were performed on inflorescence meristem and flower buds up to stage 10-11 harvested from Arabidopsis plants grown in parralel in long days conditions. Experiments were performed on 2 replicates from sep1sep2 mutant, 2 replicates from sep1sep2sep3 triples mutant, and 2 independantes complemented lines expressing SEP3 in the sep1sep2sep3 background (considered as 2 replicats).

PRJNA633096	Arabidopsis NRP switches off the PP6 phosphatase FyPP3 to repress auxin-mediated growth in response to abscisic acid (thale cress)	"How environmentally challenged plants can switch from growth to stress adaptation is an important question in plant physiology. To identify the key regulatory proteins and to characterize the underlying signaling pathways are essential in answering this question. Here we show that the abiotic stress hormone Abscisic acid (ABA) induces the expression of the Asparagine rich proteins (NRP), DCD1 and DCD2, to repress the auxin-induced growth by promoting vacuolar degradation of PIN2, the auxin efflux carrier. ABA-induced degradation of PIN2 is inhibited in the dcd1 dcd2 double mutant, and inhibition of FyPP3, the catalytic subunit of the PP6 protein phosphatase, can restore the PIN recycling and growth phenotype in the double mutant. Transcriptome analyses on WT, dcd1 dcd2, the FyPP3 Dominant Negative line (FyPP3-DN), and dcd1 dcd2/FyPP3-DN supported the essential function of the NRP-FyPP3 module in the growth- to stress-response switch.

PRJNA635903	PRP8A and PRP8B spliceosome subunits act coordinately to  control pollen tube attraction in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Purpose: Alternative splicing is fundamental for post-transcriptional regulation and proteome diversity. The goals of this study are to compare transcriptome and splicing profiling (RNA-seq) between wild type and prp8a prp8b mutant ovules of the spliceosome subunit and define the molecular signature of prp8a prp8b pollen tube attraction phenotype.
Methods: mRNA profiles from mature ovules of 6-weeks-old wild-type (WT) and pre-mRNA processing factor 8 (PRP8Aa prp8bb) Arabidopsis plants were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicates, using Illumina HiSeq4000 100bp paired-end reads. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were were mapped to TAIR10 whole genome and analyzed for differential expression, differential exone usage and intron retention as indicated in DATA PROCESSING PIPELINE section.
Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, about 15 million sequence read pairs per sample were mapped to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10). Approximately 2.9% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and PRP8Aa prp8bb ovules, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Analysis for differential gene expression, exon usage and intron retention with DESeq2 v1.22.1 and DEXseq v1.28.0 or IRFinder v1.2.3 respectively, uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to pollen tube attraction and female gametophyte cell fate specification.
Conclusions: Our work has uncovered a molecular signature through which PRP8A/PRP8B subunits act redundantly to define male-female signaling competence for successful pollen tube attraction in Arabidopsis. Application of DESeq2 algorithms to our ovule RNA-seq data identified downregulation of over 50 different CRP genes with yet unknown function from the synergid and the central cells including all LURE pollen tube attractants. Whereas use of DEXseq workflow, revealed mis-splicing of key genes involved embryo sac specificiation and genes of the secretory pathway. We concluded that 100bp paired-end RNAseq was a sufficient compromise for detection of differential gene expression and splice isoforms, however, our experiment would have benefited with more number of replicates.

Then, a second (triggering) cold stimulus (24 h 4 °C) and a triggering high-light stimulus (2 h 800 µmol quanta m-2 s-1), which regulate many stress responsive genes in the same direction in naïve plants, caused widely specific and even inverse regulation of priming-responsive genes.
Overall design: Transcript levels were assessed in a transcriptome wide scale by single end next generation sequencing (Illumina High-Seq4000). Half of the 4-week old Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 plants were primed for 24 hours at 4 °C. 5 days after priming, 1/3 of the non-primed and 1/3 of the cold-primed plants were harvested before triggering (non-primed control plants = C, primed plants = P). Half of the remaining primed and half of the remaining cold-primed plants were cold triggering for 24 hours at 4 °C (cold primed + cold triggered = PT-C; only cold trigger = T-C). The other plants were exposed for two hours at 800 μmol quanta*m−2 s−1 (cold primed + light triggered = PT-L ; only light trigger = T-L), which similarly induces the cold-primable gene ZAT10 in naïve plants.

The experiment was designed to identify and compare differentially expressed genes (DEGs) between WT and HRE1α-overexpressing transgneic plants (OXs) and WT and HRE1β OXs grown for 14 days under SD conditions. We analyzed the biological process gene ontology (GO) annotation categories of the DEGs in HRE1α OXs and HRE1β OXs. The genes upregulated in HRE1α OXs, but not in HRE1β OXs, were enriched in the regulation of biological processes such as flower development, shoot system development, circadian rhythms, gene expression, response to gibberellin, nitrogen compound metabolic process, and aromatic compound biosynthetic processes. However, the genes up-regulated in HRE1β OXs, but not in HRE1α OXs, were enriched in the regulation of the following processes: response to toxic substances, secondary metabolic processes, response to biotic stimulus, glutathione metabolic process, response to reactive oxygen species, cell wall organization, DNA replication, response to salicylic acid, lipid localization, response to oxidative stress, carbohydrate metabolic process, photosynthesis, mitotic cell cycle process, response to osmotic stress, and response to abscisic acid. The genes upregulated in both HRE1α OXs and HRE1β OXs were enriched in biological processes involved in response to abiotic stimulus, response to light stimulus, response to endogenous stimulus, response to oxygen-containing compound, and response to lipid. In addition, we investigated the biological function of AtRH17, a DEAD-box RNA helicase gene in Arabidopsis, in salt stress response. To investigate the downstream regulatory mechanisms of AtRH17, Quant-Seq analysis was carried out. The experiment was designed to identify DEGs between WT and AtRH17 OXs grown for 14 days under SD conditions. GO annotation enrichment and KEGG pathway analysis showed that the upregulated and downregulated genes are involved in various biological functions including secretion, signaling, detoxification, metabolic pathways, catabolic pathways, and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites as well as in stress responses. Genevestigator analysis of the upregulated genes showed that nine genes, namely, LEA4‐5, GSTF6, DIN2/BGLU30, TSPO, GSTF7, LEA18, HAI1, ABR, and LTI30, were upregulated in Arabidopsis under salt, osmotic, and drought stress conditions. In particular, the expression levels of LEA4‐5, TSPO, and ABR were higher in AtRH17 OXs than in WT under salt stress condition.
Overall design: Differentially expressed genes between WT and HRE1α OX, WT and HRE1β OX, and WT and AtRH17 OX at 14 days after germination under SD conditions (8-h-light and 16-h-dark cycle) were explored in whole genome level.

PRJNA638728	Transcriptome-based prediction of nitrogen use efficiency in Arabidopsis and maize - I	"Inferring phenotypic outcome from genomics features is the promise and challenge for basic and applied research. Functionally testing whether the feature(s) with predictive power can shed light on the underlying mechanism remains largely unexplored. We address these gaps by applying a machine learning approach to predict phenotypes based on transcriptome data. We validate the predictive models in silico using out-of-sample varieties and in planta by reverse genetics. Our study primarily focuses on a agronomic trait nitrogen use efficiency (NUE), but the described approach can be applied to any phenotype across biology, agriculture and medicine.
We measure NUE and gene expression from natural and cultivated varieties of Arabidopsis and maize, respectively, under low and high N environments. We integrate transcriptomics across a model and a crop and demonstrate that identifying the evolutionarily conserved N-responsive differentially expressed genes is an efficient technique to reduce the feature dimensionality, which ultimately improves the predictive power of the gene-to-trait models learned. Furthermore, including a model organism with a comprehensive mutant collection has enabled the efficient validation of the role candidate genes with predictive power in NUE outcomes.
Using the matched transcriptomic and phenotypic data from a model and crop species, we present an analysis pipeline to infer a complex trait from transcript abundance. This analysis pipeline can be applied to any other organisms to uncover novel genes underpinning physiological traits of interest.
Overall design: Arabidopsis: 108 samples were analyzed, including 18 accessions in two nitrogen conditions with 3 replicates each.

PRJNA639271	Role of H1 and DNA methylation in selective regulation of transposable elements during heat stress (thale cress)	"Heat stressed Arabidopsis plants release heterochromatin-associated transposable element (TE) silencing, which however is not accompanied by major reductions of epigenetic repressive modifications. In this study, we explored the functional role of histone H1 in repressing heterochromatic TEs in response to heat stress. Loss of H1 caused activation of pericentromeric GYPSY elements upon heat treatment, despite that these elements remained highly methylated. In contrast, non-pericentromeric COPIA elements became activated concomitantly with loss of DNA methylation. The same COPIA elements became activated in heat-treated chromomethylase2 (cmt2) mutants, indicating that H1 represses COPIA elements through maintaining DNA methylation under heat. We discovered that H1 is required for TE repression in response to heat stress, but its functional role differs depending on TE location. Strikingly, H1 deficient plants treated with the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor zebularine were highly tolerant to heat stress, suggesting that both, H1 and DNA methylation redundantly suppress the plant response to heat stress.
Overall design: We generated and analyzed RNA and bisulfite-sequencing data of wild-type, h1, and cmt2 mutant seedlings before and after heat stress. Less..."

PRJNA639463	A photoregulatory mechanism of the circadian clock in plants [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Circadian clocks are the time-keeping cellular apparatuses that are photoentrained according to the day-night photocycles on Earth 1,2.  Cryptochromes (CRYs) are photoreceptors mediating photoentrainment of the circadian clock in plants and animals but how CRYs mediate light regulation of the molecular clock remains unclear 1,3.  Here we show that CRYs mediate photoresponses of the circadian clock by regulating the activity of N6-methyladenosine (m6A) RNA methyltransferase and photoresponses of the epitranscriptome.  In contrast to the presently known CRY complexome, the CRY2-methyltransferase complex exbibits multivalent interactions and photoresponsive condensation in response to blue light.  We show that photoexcited CRY2 undergoes phosphorylation-assisted demixing to form photobodies with the properties of condensed liquid phase, which facilitates assembly of the CRY2-methyltransferase complex in the condensed liquid phase of CRY2 in vivo.  The mta mutant impaired in m6A methyltransferase and the cry1cry2 mutant missing CRY photoreceptors share common defects of lengthened circadian period, reduced m6A RNA methylation, and accelerated degradation of mRNAs encoding core components of the molecular clock.  These results argue for a photoentrainment mechanism by which blue light elicits liquid-liquid phase separation of the CRY2-methyltransferase complex to regulate m6A mRNA methylation, consequently suppressing mRNA degradation and period lengthening of the circadian clock

Here, we report the identification of an evolutionarily conserved WD40 domain protein as a player in miRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis thaliana. A mutation in the REDUCTION IN BLEACHED VEIN AREA (RBV) gene encoding a WD40 domain protein led to the suppression of leaf bleaching caused by an artificial miRNA; the mutation also led to a global reduction in the accumulation of endogenous miRNAs. The nuclear protein RBV promotes the transcription of MIR genes into pri-miRNAs by enhancing the occupancy of RNA polymerase II (Pol II) at MIR gene promoters. RBV also promotes the loading of miRNAs into AGO1. In addition, RNA-seq revealed a global splicing defect in the mutant. Thus, this evolutionarily conserved, nuclear WD40 domain protein acts in miRNA biogenesis and RNA splicing.

The goals of this study are to compare NGS-derived retinal transcriptome profiling (RNA-seq) to microarray and quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT–PCR) methods and to evaluate protocols for optimal high-throughput data analysis
Methods: Arabidopsis mRNA profiles of 9-day-old wild-type (WT) and nid1 knockout mutant plants were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using Illumina GAIIx. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with two methods: Burrows–Wheeler Aligner (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. qRT–PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays
Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 30 million sequence reads per sample to Arabidopsis sample and identified 16,014 transcripts in the WT and Nrl−/− mice with BWA workflow and 34,115 transcripts with TopHat workflow. RNA-seq data confirmed stable expression of 25 known housekeeping genes, and 12 of these were validated with qRT–PCR. RNA-seq data had a linear relationship with qRT–PCR for more than four orders of magnitude and a goodness of fit (R2) of 0.8798. Approximately 10% of the transcripts showed differential expression between the WT and Nrl−/− retina, with a fold change ≥1.5 and p value <0.05. Altered expression of 25 genes was confirmed with qRT–PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method. Hierarchical clustering of differentially expressed genes uncovered several as yet uncharacterized genes that may contribute to retinal function. Data analysis with BWA and TopHat workflows revealed a significant overlap yet provided complementary insights in transcriptome profiling.
Conclusions: Our  study represents the first detailed analysis of nid1 transcripts, with  biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. The optimized data  analysis workflows reported here should provide a framework for comparative  investigations of expression profiles. Our results show that NGS offers a  comprehensive and more accurate quantitative and qualitative evaluation of  mRNA content within a cell or tissue. We conclude that RNA-seq based  transcripts characterization would expedite genetic network analyses and  permit the dissection of complex biologic functions.

Methods: PolyA RNA from WT, MiEFF18 overexpressor and smd1b mutant seedlings were sequenced using the illumina NextSeq500 sequencer, in triplicate. Total RNA was extracted from the roots of the three Arabidopsis lines (Col0, OE-MiEFF18#13.6 and smd1b) with TriZol (Invitrogen), according to the Invitrogen protocol. The RNA was treated with DNAse treatment (Ambion), and its quality and integrity were assessed with a Bioanalyzer (Agilent). Libraries were constructed with the Tru-Seq Stranded mRNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina®). Paired-end sequencing with 75-bp reads was performed on a NextSeq500 perform. A minimum of 30 million paired-end reads per sample was generated. RNA-seq preprocessing included the trimming of library adapters and quality controls with Trimmomatic. Paired-end reads with a Phred Quality Score Qscore > 20 and a read length > 30 bases were retained, and ribosomal RNA sequences were removed with SortMeRNA. Processed reads were aligned using Tophat2 with the following arguments: --max-multihits 1 -i 20 --min-segment-intron 20 --min-coverage-intron 20 --library-type fr-firststrand --microexon-search -I 1000 --max-segment-intron 1000 --max-coverage-intron 1000 --b2-very-sensitive.
Conclusions: MiEFF18 overexpression modifies the expression of genes important for the ontogenesis of giant cells, notably those involved in microtubule cytoskeleton reorganization and cell cycle regulation, strongly suggesting that MiEFF18-mediated SmD1 inactivation in plants leads to a loss of susceptibility to root-knot nematodes.

The proper phasing of the plant circadian clock, which is mainly determined by circadian period, can provide the growth fitness for plants by facilitating the endogenous rhythms to match the external day–night cycle. Here we provide the comprehensive evidences that genomic 5-methylcytosine is critical for regulating circadian period. We found that chemical inhibition of DNA methyltransferases could significantly lengthen circadian period in the seedlings of Arabidopsis. Dysfunction of methyltransferases met1-3 and drm1 drm2 cmt3 cmt2 for both hypo-CG and hypo-non-CG texts can dramatically lengthen circadian period. To find the target genes of 5mC for modulating the circadian period, we conducted RNAseq experiments of Aza vs Mock at ZT1 h or ZT13 h time window and ddcc vs Col-0 at LL 24 h or LL36 time window. Each sample has two biological replicates.

PRJNA643438	Transcriptional responses of wild-type and abr1 mutant Arabidopsis plants to infection with Pseudomonas syringae (thale cress)	"Pathogens secrete effector proteins into host cells in order to suppress host immunity and promote pathogen virulence, although many features at the molecular interface of host-pathogen interactions remain to be characterized.  In a yeast two-hybrid assay, we found that the Pseudomonas syringae effector HopZ1a interacts with the Arabidopsis transcriptional regulator Abscisic Acid Repressor 1 (ABR1).  Further analysis revealed that ABR1 interacts with multiple P. syringae effectors, suggesting that it may be targeted as a susceptibility hub.  Indeed, loss-of-function abr1 mutants exhibit reduced susceptibility to a number of P. syringae strains.  The ABR1 protein comprises a conserved APETALA2 (AP2) domain flanked by long regions of predicted structural disorder.  We verified the DNA-binding activity of the AP2 domain and demonstrated that the disordered domains act redundantly to enhance DNA binding and to facilitate transcriptional activation by ABR1.  Finally, we compared gene expression profiles from wild-type and abr1 plants following inoculation with P. syringae, which suggested that the reduced susceptibility of abr1 mutants is due to the loss of a virulence target rather than an enhanced immune response.  These data highlight ABR1 as a functionally important component at the host-pathogen interface.
Overall design: Wild-type and abr1 mutants infiltrated with either 10 mM MgCl2 (Control), 1 x 10^8 cfu/mL Pseudmonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000, or 1 x 10^8 cfu/mL P. syringae pv. tomato DC3000 ΔhrcC (three biological replicates each for a total of 18 samples) Less..."

PRJNA643778	Histone H3K4 methyltransferase ATX1 positively regulates secondary wall biosynthesis in interfascicular fibers in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Secondary wall thickening in the sclerenchyma cells is strictly controlled by a complex network of transcription factors in vascular plant. However, little is known about the epigenetic mechanism regulating secondary cell wall biosynthesis. Genome-wide analysis revealed that the up-regulation of genes involved in secondary wall formation during stem development is largely coordinated by increasing level of H3K4 tri-methylation. In this study, we identified that ARABIDOPSIS HOMOLOG of TRITHORAX1 (ATX1), a H3K4-histone methyltransferase, positively regulates secondary wall deposition mainly through activating the expression of secondary wall NAC master switch genes, SECONDARY WALL-ASSOCIATED NAC DOMAIN PROTEIN1 (SND1) and NAC SECONDARY WALL THICKENING PROMOTING FACTOR1 (NST1).

PRJNA646453	DEAD-box RNA helicase 27-Mediated MicroRNA Biogenesis Is Essential for Zygote Division and Stem Cell Homeostasis in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Zygote division and stem cell homeostasis are crucial events for plant development. Here, we found that mutations in DEAD-box RNA helicase 27 (RH27) affected zygote division and stem cell homeostasis in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana). The strong mutant allele rh27-1 showed a zygote-lethal phenotype, while the weak mutant allele rh27-2 showed defective embryogenesis and compromised stem cell homeostasis in both the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and root apical meristem (RAM). RH27 was expressed in embryos from the zygote stage, and in the SAM and RAM. Cytological analyses revealed that stem cell homeostasis in the SAM and RAM was disrupted in rh27-2. Then, the expression levels of genes related to stem cell homeostasis were elevated in rh27-2, which coincides with down-regulations of their corresponding negative regulatory microRNAs. Furthermore, small RNA-sequencing indicated that the reduction of miRNAs was a global effect in both shoot apices and root tips of rh27-2. Additionally, the accumulation of pri-miRNAs was detected to be decreased. Biochemical studies showed that the nucleus-localized RH27 interacted directly with SERRATE, a component of the microprocessor complex, and DAWDLE, which facilitates the recruitment of substrates to the complex, suggesting that RH27 is a subunit of the microprocessor complex. Overall, this work provides evidences that RH27 regulates zygote division and stem cell homeostasis in Arabidopsis through miRNA biogenesis.

PRJNA646744	Oxicam-type nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs inhibit NPR1-mediated salicylic acid pathway (thale cress)	"Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), including salicylic acid (SA), target mammalian cyclooxygenases. In plants, SA is a defense hormone that regulates NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED GENES 1 (NPR1), the master transcriptional regulator of immunity-related genes. We identify that the oxicam-type NSAIDs tenoxicam (TNX), meloxicam, and piroxicam, but not other types of NSAIDs, exhibit an inhibitory effect on immunity to bacteria and SA-dependent plant immune response. TNX treatment decreases NPR1 levels, independently from the proposed SA receptors NPR3 and NPR4. Instead, TNX induces oxidation of cytosolic redox status, which is also affected by SA and regulates NPR1 homeostasis. A cysteine labeling assay reveals that cysteine residues in NPR1 can be oxidized in vitro, leading to disulfide-bridged oligomerization of NPR1, but not in vivo regardless of SA or TNX treatment. Therefore, this study indicates that oxicam inhibits NPR1-mediated SA signaling without affecting the redox status of NPR1.
Overall design: Fourteen-day-old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS medium with 0.8% (w/v) agar and 1% (w/v) sucrose were transferred to 1/2 MS liquid medium with 1% (w/v) sucrose and further incubated for 1 day.

PRJNA647214	H2AK121ub in Arabidopsis favors a less accessible chromatin state at transcriptional regulation hotspots [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Although it is well established that Polycomb Group (PcG) complexes maintain gene repression through the incorporation of H2AK121ub and H3K27me3, little is known about the effect of these modifications on chromatin, which is fundamental to understand PcG function. Here, by integrating chromatin accessibility, histone marks and expression analyses in different Arabidopsis PcG mutants, we show that H2AK121ub marking favors a less accessible but still permissive chromatin at transcriptional regulation hotspots, which can be further reduced by EMF1 and H3K27me3. We found that when acting concurrently, H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 establish an inaccessible but responsive chromatin to marks levels, allowing gene reprograming. Conversely, when H3K27me3 is alone, chromatin is less responsive, indicating that H2AK121ub-marked hotspots are required for transcriptional responses. Interestingly, despite the loss of H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 leads to increased chromatin accessibility, this is not necessarily accompanied by transcriptional activation, indicating that gene expression is not always predictive of accessible chromatin.
Overall design: Arabidopsis seedlings Col-0 wild type, atbmi1abc triple mutant, clf28/swn7 double mutant, emf1-2 mutant, ring1ab double mutant and lhp1 mutant were grown under long-day condition (16 hr of light/8 hr of dark) at 22 °C on MS agar plates containing 1% sucrose and 0.7% agar and collected at 10 DAG (days after germination).

PRJNA648424	Chemical genetics approach identifies ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM 1 as a putative target of a novel sulfonamide that protects Arabidopsis against photorespiratory stress [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Alterations of hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) levels have a profound impact on numerous signaling cascades orchestrating stress responses, plant growth and development, including programmed cell death. To expand the repertoire of known molecular mechanisms implicated in H2O2 signaling, we performed a forward chemical screen to identify small molecules that could alleviate the photorespiratory-induced cell death phenotype of Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking H2O2 scavenging capacity by peroxisomal CATALASE2. Here, we report the characterization of pakerine, a m-sulfamoyl benzamide from the sulfonamide family. Pakerine alleviates the cell death phenotype of cat2 mutants exposed to photorespiration-promoting conditions and delays dark-induced senescence in wild type Arabidopsis leaves. By using a combination of transcriptomics, metabolomics and affinity purification we identified ABNORMAL INFLORESCENCE MERISTEM 1 (AIM1) as a putative protein target of pakerine. AIM1 is a 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydrogenase involved in β-fatty acid oxidation that contributes to jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid (SA) biosynthesis. Whereas intact JA biosynthesis was not required for pakerine bioactivity, our results point towards a role for β-oxidation-dependent SA production in execution of H2O2-mediated cell death.
Overall design: Gene expression analysis of CATALASES2 deficient Arabidopsis thaliana plants exposed to a combinatorial treatment of photorespiratory inducing growth conditions and a chemical treatment of a chemical alleviating the enhanced cell death phenotype of the mutant plants.

Overall design: Meloidogyne javanica-induced galls and control roots mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing with Illumina HiSeq X PE150.
Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in controlled environment chambers under 16 h/8 h of light/dark at 23ºC. Arabidopsis plants were inoculated at 5 days post germination at the root tip with approximately 20 freshly-hatched Meloidogyne J2 each plant. The inoculated and non-inoculated plants were then kept in the dark for 2 days, in plates horizontally orientated. During the first 48 hours, the infections and control roots growth were assessed. After 2 days, the plates containing both inoculated and non-inoculated plants were maintained in the light, vertically orientated and covered by a gauze. For more details concerning this protocol please see Olmo et al. (2017; doi: 10.1007/978-1-4939-6831-2_5). Galls and control root segments were collected at 3 days post infection and frozen on liquid nitrogen. Galls and control root segments (RC) from at least three independent experiments were pooled together per sample. For each treatment, three independent biological samples (G1, G2 and G3 for galls; RC1, RC2 and RC3 for RC) were used for total RNA extraction. Total RNA was extracted using the AllPrep DNA/RNA/miRNA Universal Kit from Qiagen with several adaptations (Silva et al., 2019; doi: 10.3389/fpls.2019.00657).
Illumina's TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit was used to prepare the libraries, strictly following the manufacturer's instructions. The fragment size distribution of the libraries were checked in the Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer using the Agilent High Sensitivity DNA Kit. The libraries were then sequenced in a fraction of an Illumina HiSeq X PE150. Both steps were performed by the company AllGenetics & Biology SL.(Spain).
For the bioinformatic analysis, the reads were firstly checked for quality using FastQC (version 0.11.8). Trimming was then performed using BBDuk (version 38.39).

Here, we explore the dynamic relationship between chromatin accessibility and epigenetic modifications during life form transitions in Arabidopsis. The diploid-to-haploid life form transition is governed by the loss of H3K9me2 and DNA demethylation of transposon-associated cis-regulatory elements, which is associated with dramatic changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional reprogramming. In contrast, the global loss of H3K27me3 in the haploid form shapes a chromatin accessibility landscape that is poised to re-initiate the transition back to diploid life after fertilization. These distinct epigenetic reprogramming events rewire transcription through major reorganization of the regulatory epigenome to guide the alternation of generations in flowering plants.

PRJNA649954	Polycomb-dependent differential chromatin compartmentalization determines gene co-regulation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Previous studies in animals have shown that polycomb targets marked with H3K27me3 can establish interactions between them, forming a repressive chromatin hub (Lanzuolo et al., 2007; Cheutin and Cavalli, 2014). In plants few studies suggested that H3K27me3 may act directly or indirectly to regulate the interactivity of polycomb marked genes. However, several aspects of the molecular function of the H3K27me3 histone modification on the 3D chromatin architecture remained obscure. To decipher the impact of H3K27me3 levels on loop formation, we combined genetics, 3D epigenomics and transcriptomic approaches. By using the ref6 mutant, defective for a histone demethylase, that displays ectopic accumulation of H3K27me3, we demonstrated that H3K27me3 is important to trigger chromatin loop formation. Reciprocally, using clf mutant, a histone methyltransferase mutant that displays a strong reduction of H3K27me3 we found that a reduction of the H3K27me3 leads to the decrease of interactions inside the polycomb repressive domain. Surprisingly, we observed that regions losing H3K27me3 in clf establish new interactions with regions marked with the H3K9ac active histone modification, showing that a reduction in H3K27me3 levels induces a global reconfiguration of chromatin architecture. Altogether our results demonstrate that the 3D organization of the genome is tightly linked to histone modifications that trigger the formation of chromatin domains associated with gene co-regulation, thereby allowing proper plant development and in which H3K27me3 is a key regulator of chromatin topology at global and local scales.

PRJNA656261	The cyanobacterium, Nostoc punctiforme can protect against programmed cell death and induce defence genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. (thale cress)	"Many cyanobacteria can form nitrogen-fixing symbioses with a broad range of plant species. Unlike other plant-bacteria symbioses, little is understood about the immunological responses induced by plant cyanobionts (symbiotic cyanobacteria). Here, we used Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell cultures as a model system to demonstrate that the model plant-symbiotic cyanobacteria, Nostoc punctiforme is capable of protecting against plant programmed cell death (PCD). We also profiled the early transcriptomic changes that were induced in response to conditioned medium (CM) from N. punctiforme cell cultures. Interestingly, the PCD reduction was preceded by the induction of genes associated with defence and immunity, the most striking of which were a number of WRKY-family transcription factors. Down-regulated included genes involved in the regulation of cell growth and differentiation. This work is the first to show that a cyanobacteria can regulate plant PCD and provides a useful transcriptome resource for studying early plant cell responses to symbiotic cyanobacteria.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana suspension cell cultures were incubated with a 20% volume/volume of conditioned medium (CM) from Nostoc punctiforme liquid cultures. As a control treatment, cells were instead incubated with a 20% volume of fresh N. punctiforme growth medium (BG) (growth medium in which no cells were previously grown).

PRJNA658687	Autophagy mutants show delayed chloroplast development during de-etiolation in carbon limiting conditions (thale cress)	"Autophagy is a conserved catabolic process that plays an essential role under nutrient starvation condition and influences different developmental processes. We observed that seedlings of autophagy mutants (atg2, atg5, atg7, and atg9) germinated in the dark showed delayed chloroplast development following illumination. The delayed chloroplast development was characterized by a decrease in photosynthetic and chlorophyll biosynthetic proteins, lower chlorophyll content, reduced chloroplast size, and increased levels of proteins involved in lipid biosynthesis. Confirming the biological impact of these differences, photosynthetic performance was impaired in autophagy mutants 12h post illumination. We observed that while gene expression for photosynthetic machinery during de-etiolation was largely unaffected in atg mutants, several genes involved in photosystem assembly were transcriptionally downregulated. We also investigated if the delayed chloroplast development could be explained by lower lipid import to the chloroplast or lower triglyceride (TAG) turnover. We observed that the limitations in the chloroplast lipid import imposed by trigalactosyldiacylglycerol1 are unlikely to explain the delay in chloroplast development. However, we found that lower TAG mobility in the triacylglycerol lipase mutant sugardependent1 significantly affected de-etiolation. Moreover, we showed that lower levels of carbon resources exacerbated the slow-greening phenotype whereas higher levels of carbon resources had an opposite effect. This work suggests a lack of autophagy machinery limits chloroplast development during de-etiolation, and this is exacerbated by limited lipid turnover (lipophagy) that physically or energetically restrains chloroplast development.
Overall design: We used Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) seeds of Col-0 as WT, four autophagic mutants atg2-1 (SALK_076727, Yoshimoto et al. 2009), atg5-1 (SAIL_129B07, Chen et al. 2015), atg7-2 (GABI_655B06, Lai et al. 2011) and atg9-2 (SALK_130796, Zhuang et al. 2017) which we referred as atg2, atg5, atg7 and atg9 respectively, a lipid thylakoid permease mutant tgd1 (Xu et al., 2003), a TAG lipase mutant (sugar-dependent 1-4) sdp1-4 (Eastmond, 2006; Fan et al., 2017) and the respective lipid and autophagy double mutants tgd1atg2-1, tgd1 atg5-1, sdp1atg2-1, and sdp1 atg5-1 (Fan et al., 2019).

PRJNA659738	RNA-seq analysis of callus of Arabidopsis WT and wox5-1 wox7-1 (thale cress)	"In plant tissue culture, callus forms from detached explants in response to a high-auxin-to-low-cytokinin ratio on callus-inducing medium. Callus is a group of pluripotent cells because it can regenerate either roots or shoots in response to a low level of auxin on root-inducing medium or a high-cytokinin-to-low-auxin ratio on shoot-inducing medium, respectively1. However, our knowledge of the mechanism of pluripotency acquisition during callus formation is limited. On the basis of analyses at the single-cell level, we show that the tissue structure of Arabidopsis thaliana callus on callus-inducing medium is similar to that of the root primordium or root apical meristem, and the middle cell layer with quiescent centre-like transcriptional identity exhibits the ability to regenerate organs. In the middle cell layer, WUSCHEL-RELATED HOMEOBOX5 (WOX5) directly interacts with PLETHORA1 and 2 to promote TRYPTOPHAN AMINOTRANSFERASE OF ARABIDOPSIS1 expression for endogenous auxin production. WOX5 also interacts with the B-type ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR12 (ARR12) and represses A-type ARRs to break the negative feedback loop in cytokinin signalling.

However, genome-wide enhancer characterization has been challenging due to the lack of a well-defined relationship between enhancers and genes. Here, we applied a massively parallel reporter assay on Arabidopsis to measure enhancer activities across the genome. We identified 4327 enhancers with various combinations of epigenetic modifications distinctively different from animal enhancers. Furthermore, we showed that enhancers differ from promoters in their preference for transcription factors. Although some enhancers are not conserved and overlap with transposable elements forming clusters, enhancers are generally conserved across thousand Arabidopsis species, suggesting they are selected under evolution pressure and could play critical roles in the regulation of important genes. Moreover, comparison analysis reveals that enhancers identified by different strategies do not overlap, suggesting these methods are complementary in nature. In sum, our work provides an additional catalog of enhancers and lays the foundation for further investigation into enhancers’ functional mechanisms in plants.

PRJNA660185	Coordination of microbe-host homeostasis via a crosstalk with plant innate immunity (thale cress)	"Asymptomatic plants grown in natural soil are colonized by phylogenetically structured communities of microbes known as the microbiota. Individual microbes can activate microbe-associated molecular pattern (MAMP)-triggered immunity (MTI), which limits pathogen proliferation but curtails plant growth, a phenomenon known as the growth-defense trade-off. We report that in mono-associations, 41% (62/151) of taxonomically diverse root bacteria commensals suppress Arabidopsis thaliana root growth inhibition (RGI) triggered by immune-stimulating MAMPs or damage-associated molecular patterns. Amplicon sequencing of bacteria 16S rRNA genes reveal that immune activation alters the profile of synthetic communities (SynComs) comprised of RGI-non-suppressive strains, while the presence of RGI-suppressive strains attenuates this effect. Root colonization by SynComs with different complexities and RGI-suppressive activities alters the expression of 174 core host genes with functions related to root development and nutrient transport. Further, RGI-suppressive SynComs specifically downregulate a subset of immune-related genes. Mutation of one commensal-downregulated transcription factor, MYB15, or pre-colonization with RGI-suppressive SynComs render plants more susceptible to opportunistic Pseudomonas pathogens. Our results suggest that RGI-non-suppressive and suppressive root commensals modulate host susceptibility to pathogens by either eliciting or dampening MTI responses, respectively. This interplay buffers the plant immune system against pathogen perturbation and defense-associated growth inhibition, ultimately leading to commensal-host homeostasis.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana plants were germinated with the synthetic communities (SynComs) in the presence or absence of 1 µM flg22 and incubated for 14 days before harvesting.

PRJNA639161	Parallel global profiling of plant TOR dynamics	TARGET OF RAPAMYCIN (TOR) is a deeply conserved protein kinase thatcoordinates eukaryotic metabolism with nutrient availability. In mammals, TORspecifically promotes translation of ribosomal protein mRNAs when amino acids areavailable to support protein synthesis. The mechanisms controlling translationdownstream from TOR remain contested, however, and are largely unexplored inplants. Here, we took parallel global profiling approaches to define the in planta TOR-regulated transcriptome, translatome, proteome, and phosphoproteome. We found thatTOR regulates ribosome biogenesis in plants at multiple levels, but throughmechanisms that do not directly depend on the canonical 5 oligopyrimidine tract motif(5TOP) found in mammalian ribosomal protein mRNAs. To investigate this further, wefocused on a putative TOR substrate identified in our phosphoproteome: LARP1, aeukaryotic RNA-binding protein that is proposed to mediate TOR translational control of5TOP mRNAs in humans and that has gained increased interest because it associateswith SARS-CoV-2. By conducting parallel global profiling experiments with larp1mutants, we discovered that the TOR-LARP1 signaling axis controls 5TOP mRNAtranslation in plants and defined a set of conserved eukaryotic 5TOP mRNAs thatencode cyclins, importins/karyopherins, translation elongation factors, and TCTP1,among others. We then identified novel, plant-specific 5TOP mRNAs involved in criticalbiological processes, including ribosome biogenesis, chromatin remodeling, and auxinsignaling. Our study illuminates the ancestral roles of the TOR-LARP1-5TOP metabolicregulatory network and provides evolutionary context for ongoing debates about themolecular function of LARP1 in eukaryotic cells.

PRJDB8904	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Epigenetic regulation of spurious transcription initiation in Arabidopsis	"In plants, epigenetic regulation is critical for silencing repetitive sequences and maintaining proper expression of transcription units. However, its functional impacts on genome-wide transcription initiation landscape remains largely elusive.
To dissect the role of epigenetic regulation in shaping plant transcription initiation landscape we generated genome-wide maps of transcription start sites (TSSs) at a single-nucleotide resolution in representative mutants of epigenetic modifiers in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana (A.thaliana) by Cap Analysis of Gene Expression followed by sequencing (CAGE-seq). Our analysis revealed that about one-third of the TSSs identified across all conditions are exclusively activated in the mutant backgrounds, where epigenetic control is compromised. Thousands of these sites have yet been annotated, suggesting that they are likely cryptic TSSs silenced under normal condition by epigenetic mechanisms. Consistently, these TSSs mainly locate at genomic regions highly decorated with heterochromatic modifications and possessing sequence architecture similar to that of regular plant promoters. Maintenance DNA methylation pathway facilitated by METHYLTRANSFERASE 1 (MET1) regulates the largest number of cryptic TSSs,
which also largely overlap with targets regulated by other epigenetic pathways. Transposable elements (TEs) from both retro- and DNA transposon families, which function as a reservoir of putative regulatory elements in A.thaliana genome, contribute up to 65% of the cryptic TSSs. Importantly, the activation of cryptic TSSs significantly attenuates regular transcription initiated from nearby TSSs, likely through a poorly characterized mechanism of transcriptional interference. Such attenuation may affect the plant's development and ability to respond to environmental stresses. Our study, therefore, sheds lights on a novel role of epigenetic regulation in maintaining proper gene functions in plants by suppressing spurious transcription from cryptic TSSs. Less..."	
PRJDB8937	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Transcriptome analysis of an Arabidopsis thaliana atark mutant.	In Arabidopsis, ABA signaling is transmitted through activation of a plant-specific kinase SnRK2. Previously we identified an ARK belonging to the group B3 MAPKKK as a novel upstream factor of SnRK2 in the moss Physcomitrella patens. ARK was essential for ABA- and osmostress-induced activation of SnRK2 in P. patens. Arabidopsis has 6 genes belonging to B3 MAPKKK and we showed that 3 genes (AtARK1, AtARK2, AtARK3) could complement ARK function in P. patens. To gain insight into the function of B3 MAPKKK in ABA and osmostress responses in Arabidopsis, we performed a transcriptome analysis of atark triple mutant and WT plants treated with 50 ?M ABA or osmostress (300 mM) sorbitol for 1h and 3h.

Nevertheless, response mechanisms of 1O2 signaling under different stress conditions still remain unknown. To discover the specific contribution of 1O2-mediated and EXECUTER(EX)-dependent signaling during disease development of Arabidopsis, RNAseq was conducted to analyse the expression pattern of 1O2 response genes in Col-0 and ex1ex2 mutant plants after inoculation of necrotrophic Alternaria alternata wild type or TeA toxin-deficient mutant DHP001 strains. Methods: RNAseq libraries were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq X Ten plantform with standard Illumina protocols.

PRJNA613833	Transgenerational responses to Pseudomonas infection in Arabidopsis	Research on plant immune responses to bacterial pathogens has been complicated by two revelations of the high-throughput sequencing era of plant biology: (1) Microbiome sequencing has revealed that plants are frequently infected by multiple pathogens simultaneously. Controlled lab studies show that the defense systems activated by different pathogens may even antagonize each other via hormonal crosstalk. Thus, an understanding of how co-infection differs from the single infections typically studied in the lab is essential for translating knowledge of plant immunity to field settings. (2) Epigenetic marks on plant genomes are altered by pathogen infection and these changes can be transmitted to offspring, meaning that offspring plant immune responses can depend upon, or be primed by, parental infections. Knowledge of the pervasiveness and duration of priming is necessary to understand how plant immunity works in real populations.To study the effects of co-infection on transgenerational defense priming in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we generated plant lineages with different histories of single- and multi-pathogen infections across generations and collected leaf tissue from parental and offspring plants for transcriptome sequencing (mRNA-seq). We considered two bacterial pathogens isolated from natural A. thaliana populations: Pseudomonas syringae (Michigan strain NP29.1A) and Pseudomonas viridiflava (Michigan strain RMX3.1B). With the RNA-seq libraries, we aim to compare the loci where expression is primed by simultaneous infection as opposed to single infections. We considered two A. thaliana genotypes (Col-0 and Are-0) in order to understand how natural genetic variation affects transcriptional responses to multiple infections. Less...

PRJNA596617	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	Twin arginine translocation (TAT) pathways have been extensively studied in bacteria and chloroplasts for their role in membrane translocation of folded proteins. However, an increasing number of organisms have been found to contain mitochondria-located TAT subunits. Including plant mitochondria which contain TAT subunits, though an unusual arrangement with only TatB and TatC subunits. To date, no confirmed function has been attributed to mitochondrial TAT pathways in any organism. Using a truncation mutant approach, we demonstrated that the plant mitochondrial TatB (MTTATB) is required for complex III biogenesis. More specifically, MTTATB performs at a late stage in complex III biogenesis conveying the translocation of the C-terminus of the Rieske FeS subunit back across the inner membrane. This work confirms that plant mitochondria retained a functional TAT pathway for the Rieske FeS translocation, most likely from the original mitochondria ancestor. It is hypothesized that the original mitochondria contained a bacteria-derived TAT pathway required for at least the Rieske FeS translocation. In several eukaryotic lineages this mitochondrial TAT pathway was lost and replaced by BCS1. Interestingly, plant mitochondria appear to assemble complex III in the same subunit order as yeast and mammals but in contrast use bacteria-like assembly factors for this process. Less...

PRJNA598331	Initiation of transposon silencing in the phase-separated stress granules	Transposons are mobile genetic elements that can cause fatal mutations in the genomes. To counteract these genome invaders, host genomes have evolved elaborate mechanisms which involve short interfering (si)-RNAs. In plants, RNA-DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE 6 (RDR6)-SUPPRESSOR OF GENE SILENCING 3 (SGS3) complex serves as a detector of non-self RNAs that selectively recognizes and duplexes the transposon RNAs which are then later processed to siRNAs. Transposon-derived siRNAs triggers both post-transcriptional repression and priming of epigenetic silencing. However, the regulatory mechanisms for the selective recognition of transposon RNAs and the initiation of siRNA-mediated epigenetic silencing are still unknown. Here we show that transposon RNAs undergo frequent ribosome stalling presumably owing to their unfavourable codon sequence usage, which eventually causes the RNA truncation and the localization to stress granules. The cleavage of RNAs is a critical prerequisite for RDR6 recognition of its targets. We found that transposon RNAs are more prone to RNA truncation likely mediated through translation-dependent RNA decay pathways. Stress granules are membrane-less cytoplasmic organelles, where RDR6 and SGS3 are located. We observed that SGS3 forms liquid droplets in vitro presumably through prion-like domains. Stress granules are known to contain weakly translating RNAs and indeed our stress granule-enriched RNA-seq revealed that transposon RNAs are strongly enriched in the stress granules. In short, the host genome detects transposons by their reduced translational status which leads to RNA truncation and stress granule localization that both contribute to selective targeting of transposon RNAs to the siRNA production pathway. Our study provides a novel insight into the regulatory mechanisms for the recognition of invasive genetic elements and the initiation of epigenetic silencing essential for the maintenance of genome integrity.

PRJNA592356	Epigenetics of Alternative Splicing in Plants	Plants use complex gene regulatory mechanisms to overcome environmental changes. Alternative splicing (AS) of pre-mRNAs makes an important contribution to modulate the transcriptome. Recent evidence supports the co-transcriptional regulation of AS in plants, hence the chromatin state as shown for mammals can impact AS. However, how dynamic changes in the chromatin influence the AS process remains poorly understood. We analyzed sequencing data of an epigenetic Recombinant Inbred Line (epiRIL) and compared it to its wild type parent (Columbia, Col-wt) under normal temperature and cold stress to understand how DNA methylation and chromatin differences modulate AS. We found that exons exhibit higher DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy level than introns in both Col-wt and the epiRIL. Intriguingly, exitrons, alternatively spliced internal regions of protein-coding exons, also exhibit distinctive nucleosome occupancy compared with the flanking regions that may aid in their recognition by the splicing machinery. Variation in DNA methylation and nucleosome occupancy affects global as well as core circadian clock genes (CCA1 and LHY) splicing patterns. Collectively, our data show that epigenetic differences in an identical genetic background are sufficient to modulate AS in plants. Less...

PRJNA390422	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-directed DNA methylation involves co-transcriptional small RNA-guided slicing of Pol V transcripts in Arabidopsis	"Small RNAs regulate chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and gene silencing across eukaryotic genomes. In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) requires 24-nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (siRNAs) that bind ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and target genomic regions for silencing. It also requires non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA POLYMERASE V (Pol V), although their function is largely unknown. We utilized a modified global nuclear run-on (GRO) protocol followed by deep sequencing to capture Pol V nascent transcripts genome-wide. We uncovered unique characteristics of Pol V RNAs, including a uracil (U) common at position 10. This uracil was complementary to the 5’ adenine found in many AGO4-bound 24-nt siRNAs and was eliminated in an siRNA-deficient mutant. This indicates co-transcriptional slicing of Pol V transcripts by AGO4-bound siRNAs. Pol V transcript slicing also required the elongation factor SPT5L. These results highlight a novel step in RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, which is a conserved process in many eukaryotes.

PRJNA534240	Selective egg cell polyspermy bypasses the triploid block (thale cress)	"Polyploidization, the increase in genome copies, is considered a major driving force for speciation. We have recently provided the first direct in planta evidence for polyspermy induced polyploidization. Capitalizing on a novel sco1-based polyspermy assay, we here show that polyspermy can selectively polyploidize the egg cell, while rendering the genome size of the ploidy-sensitive central cell unaffected. This unprecedented result indicates that polyspermy can bypass the triploid block, which is an established postzygotic polyploidization barrier. In fact, we here show that most polyspermy-derived seeds are insensitive to the triploid block suppressor admetos. The robustness of polyspermy-derived plants is evidenced by the first transcript profiling of triparental plants and our observation that these idiosyncratic organisms segregate tetraploid offspring within a single generation. Polyspermy-derived triparental plants are thus comparable to triploids recovered from interploidy crosses. Our results expand current polyploidization concepts and have important implications for plant breeding.

However, molecular components directly involved in this shoot-to-root communication remain to be identified. Here, we show that phloem-mobile CEPD-like 2 (CEPDL2) polypeptide is upregulated in the leaf vasculature in response to decreased shoot N status and, after translocation to the roots, promotes high-affinity uptake and root-to-shoot transport of nitrate by activating nitrate transporter genes such as NRT2.1, NRT3.1 and NRT1.5. Loss of CEPDL2 decreases nitrate uptake and root-to-shoot transport activity in roots, leading to a reduction in shoot nitrate content and plant biomass. CEPDL2 contributes to N acquisition cooperatively with CEPD1 and CEPD2 that mediate root N status, and their complete loss severely impairs N homeostasis in plants. Reciprocal grafting analysis provided conclusive evidence that the shoot CEPDL2/CEPD genotype defines the root high-affinity uptake activity of nitrate. Our results indicate that plants integrate shoot N status and root N status in leaves and systemically regulate the efficiency of root N acquisition.

PRJNA592549	Gene expression profile of Arabidopsis thaliana wild type and siz1-2 mutant during in vitro shoot regeneration on callus inducing media (CIM) and shoot inducing media (SIM) (thale cress)	"Plants form callus and regenerate new organs when incubated on phytohormone-containing media. While accumulating evidence suggests that these regenerative processes are governed by transcriptional networks orchestrating stress responses and developmental transitions, it remains unknown if post-translational regulatory mechanisms are involved in this process. Here, we find that SIZ1, which encodes an E3 ligase catalyzing attachment of the SMALL UBIQUITIN-LIKE MODIFIER (SUMO) to proteins, regulates wound-induced signal transduction and organ regeneration. We show that loss-of-function mutants for SIZ1 exhibit over-production of shoot meristems under in vitro tissue culture conditions, while this defect is rescued in a complementation line expressing pSIZ1::SIZ1. RNA-sequencing analysis revealed that siz1-2 mutant exhibits enhanced transcriptional responses to wound stress, resulting in the hyper-induction of over 500 genes immediately after wounding. Among them, we show that elevated level of WOUND INDUCED DEDIFFERENTIATION 1 (WIND1) and WIND2 contribute to enhanced shoot regeneration observed in siz1 mutants, as the dominant-negative WIND1-SRDX partly rescues this phenotype in siz1-3. Although compromised SIZ1 function does not modify transcription of genes implicated in auxin-induced callus formation and/or pluripotency acquisition, it does lead to enhanced induction of cytokinin-induced shoot meristem regulators like WUSCHEL (WUS), promoting the formation of WUS-expressing foci in explants. This study thus suggests that SIZ1 negatively regulates shoot regeneration in part by repressing wound-induced cellular reprogramming.

PRJNA594026	Naked1 targets Topless to up-regulate Auxin signaling and suppress immunity (thale cress)	"Plants integrate endogenous and environmental signals to regulate growth and developmental programs by the use different hormonal pathways. Perception of Pathogen/Microbial Associated Molecular Patterns (PAMPs/MAMPs) from invading microorganisms triggers a series of defense reactions known as Pathogen Triggered Immunity (PTI) that inhibit growth promoting signaling pathways such as auxin signaling. On the contrary, pathogens manipulate growth signaling and metabolism to promote disease susceptibility, but how this hormone acts on immunity is not fully understood. Ustilago maydis is a fungal pathogen of maize. Infected plants show formation of galls, masses of undifferentiated tissue, and upregulation of auxin signaling. Here we show that a secreted protein from U. maydis, the effector Naked1 (Nkd1), translocates into the host nucleus where it interacts with members of the Topless/Topless related family of transcriptional co-repressors.  Nkd1 binds to TPL/TPRs through its native EAR motif and prevents recruitment of transcriptional repressors involved in hormonal signaling, leading to the de-repression of jasmonic acid and auxin responsive genes. We show that up-regulation of auxin signaling leads to inhibition of PAMP-triggered ROS burst, one of the earliest PTI responses, and increased susceptibility to pathogens. Thus, establishing a clear mechanism for auxin-induced pathogen susceptibility. Using engineered variants of Nkd1, with altered affinity/specificity to TPL/TPRs, we show that increased EAR-mediated binding triggers typical salicylic acid mediated defense reactions, leading to pathogen resistance.
Overall design: mRNA expression levels were evaluated upon transgene induction. Transgene expression was induced as described above and mRNA levels of seedlings expressing effector proteins (Nkd1, Nkd1ΔEAR and Nkd1SRDX) were compared to those of seedling expressing mCherry (control).

PRJNA594539	Vascular transcription factors control epidermal responses to limiting phosphate conditions (thale cress)	"Optimal plant growth is hampered by limiting amounts of the essential macronutrient phosphate in most soils. As a response, plant roots produce root hairs to capture this immobile nutrient. Although vital to high-yielding crops, this response remains poorly understood. By generating and exploiting a high spatial and temporal resolution single cell atlas of the Arabidopsis root, we show a remarkable enrichment of TMO5/LHW target genes in root hair epidermal cells. Moreover, these vascular bHLH factors are sufficient to induce a root hair formation response in the epidermal cells, similar as observed during low phosphate conditions, via the downstream cytokinin signaling. We further show that root hair formation under low phosphate conditions is almost absent when TMO5 function or cytokinin signaling is perturbed. In conclusion, cytokinin signaling links the adaptation of roots under low phosphate conditions in the epidermis to perception in vascular cells.

Here, we conducted ribosome profiling analysis to reveal the genome-wide regulation of translation in response to boron conditions in A. thaliana. We identified 460 translationally regulated genes. Transcripts with reduced translation efficiency were rich in upstream open reading frames (uORFs), highlighting the importance of uORF-mediated translational regulation. We found that 148 uORF instances had greater ribosome density under high boron conditions. Moreover, translationally downregulated transcripts were rich in minimum uORFs (AUG-stops), suggesting that AUG-stops play a global role in the boron response. Boron increased the ribosome occupancy of stop codons, indicating that this element is involved in global translational termination processes.

PRJNA595358	Coordination and assembly of protein complexes encoded across mitochondrial and nuclear genomes is assisted by mtCLPXP in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Protein homeostasis in eukaryotic organelles and their progenitor prokaryotes is regulated by a series of ATP-dependent proteases including the caseinolytic protease complex (ClpXP).  In chloroplasts, ClpXP has essential roles in organelle biogenesis and maintenance , but the significance of the plant mitochondrial ClpXP remains unknown and factors that aid coordination of nuclear and mitochondrial encoded subunits for complex assembly in mitochondria await discovery.  In this study, we generated knock-out lines of the single copy mitochondrial Clp protease subunit, CLPP2, in Arabidopsis thaliana. They have higher abundance of transcripts from mitochondrial genes encoding OXPHOS protein complexes, while transcripts for nuclear genes encoding other subunits of the same complexes showed no change in transcript abundance. In contrast, the protein abundance of specific nuclear-encoded subunits in OXPHOS complexes I and V increased in knockouts, without accumulation of mitochondrial-encoded counterparts in the same complex. Protein complexes mainly or wholly encoded in the nucleus were unaffected. Analysis of protein import, assembly and function of Complex I revealed that while function was retained, protein homeostasis was disrupted through slower assembly, leading to accumulation of soluble subcomplexes of nuclear-encoded subunits after import.  It is proposed that CLPP contributes to the mitochondrial protein degradation network through supporting coordination and assembly of protein complexes encoded across mitochondrial and nuclear genomes.  
Overall design: Overall we analysed 9 samples of Arabidopsis thaliana total RNA extracts by high throughput RNA sequencing. The samples were 3 replicates of WT (Wild type - Arabidopsis ecotype Columbio-0, used at control), clpp2-1 (knock-out mutant 1 of the mitochondrial CLPP2 protease (AT5G23140)) and clpp2-2 (knock-out 2 of the mitochondrial CLPP2 potease).

Thus far, depletion of CG methylation in plants was associated with ample transcriptional activation of transposons. Here, we profiled transcription in various context specific methylation mutants in the early-diverged plant, Physcomitrella patens. We discovered that specific elimination of CG methylation is fully complemented by non-CG methylation but not vice versa. Between the symmetrically-methylated sites, CHG methylation silenced transposons stronger than CG methylation did. Finally, non-CG methylation revealed as crucial for the silencing of CG depleted transposons. Our results suggest that non-CG methylation evolved to silence transposons due to functional limitations and/or rapid mutability of methylated-CGs.

PRJNA595951	Ustilago maydis effector Jsi1 interacts with Topless corepressor, hijacking plant JA/ET signaling (thale cress)	"•	Ustilago maydis (U. maydis) is the causal agent of maize smut disease. During the colonization process, the fungus secretes effector proteins which suppress immune responses and redirect the host metabolism in favor of the pathogen. As effectors play a critical role during plant colonization, their identification and functional characterization is essential to understanding biotrophy and disease.
•	Using biochemical, molecular, and transcriptomic techniques, we performed a functional characterization of the U. maydis effector Jasmonate/Ethylene signaling inducer 1 (Jsi1).
•	Jsi1 interacts with several members of the plant co‐repressor family Topless/Topless related (TPL/TPR). Jsi1 expression in Zea mays (Z. mays) and Arabidopsis thaliana (A. thaliana) leads to transcriptional induction of the ethylene response factor (ERF) branch of the jasmonate/ethylene (JA/ET) signaling pathway. In A. thaliana, activation of the ERF‐branch leads to biotrophic susceptibility. Jsi1 likely activates the ERF‐branch via an EAR motif, which resembles EAR motifs from plant ERF transcription factors, that interacts with TPL/TPR proteins.
•	EAR motif‐containing effector candidates were identified from different fungal species including Magnaporthe oryzae, Sporisorium scitamineum, and Sporisorium reilianum. Interaction between plant TPL proteins and these effector candidates from biotrophic and hemibiotrophic fungi indicates the convergent evolution of effectors modulating the TPL/TPR co‐repressor hub.

PRJNA597366	Characterization of Arabidopsis thaliana promoter bidirectionality and antisense RNAs by depletion of nuclear RNA decay pathways (thale cress)	"In animals, transcription by RNA polymerase II initiates bidirectionally from gene promoters to produce pre-mRNAs on the forward strand and promoter upstream transcripts (PROMPTs) on the reverse strand. PROMPTs are rapidly degraded by the nuclear exosome. Previous studies based on nascent RNA approaches concluded that Arabidopsis thaliana does not produce PROMPTs. Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing methods in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including by the exosome, to reassess the existence of PROMPTs in A. thaliana. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, about 100 clear cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs were identified. We also found that PROMPTs become sources of 21-22 nt small interfering RNAs in exosome-deficient mutants, perhaps explaining why plants have evolved mechanisms to suppress PROMPT production. In addition, we found ~200 transcription start sites within 3’-UTR-encoding regions that produce long unspliced, exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs. The previously characterized non-coding (nc) RNA that regulates expression of the key seed dormancy regulator, DELAY OF GERMINATION1, is a typical representative of this class of RNAs. Transcription factor genes are overrepresented among loci with exosome-sensitive antisense RNAs, suggesting a potential for widespread control of gene expression via this class of ncRNAs. Lastly, we assess the use of alternative promoters in A. thaliana and compare the accuracy of existing TSS annotations.

PRJNA598201	Genome-wide expression analysis of PTI and ETI responses in wild type and PRR-deficient Arabidopsis plants (thale cress)	"Purpose: The goal of this study is to demonstrate the global expression profile of Arabidopsis wild type and PRR mutant plants in response to PTI- and ETI-eliciting strains of Pseudomonas syringae pv tomato (Pst) bacterium.
Methods: Four-week-old Arabidopsis plant leaves were infiltrated with sterile water (Mock) or different Pst strains and harvested at 3h or 6h after infiltration for RNA extraction and deep sequencing by Illumina. Raw data were cleaned up and trimmed and reads were mapped to Arabidopsis genome. Gene expression levels were calculated using the TPM method (Transcripts per Kb of exon model per Million mapped reads).
Results and Conclusions: This study showed that Pst DC3000 D36E and D36E(avrRpt2) strains both induced significant gene expression changes (with changes of more than 3000 and 7000 genes respectively) in Col-0 plant, and D36E(avrRpt2) strain induced stronger expression changes globally. Furthermore, many genes are differentially regulated in the PRR mutant plants in response to D36E inoculation compared with wild type plant; however, D36E(avrRpt2) inoculation induced very similar expression patterns in two genotypes, suggesting that ETI can largely restore PTI-associated gene expression in the PRR mutant plant. In addition, we also found that ETI can largely induce the expression levels of many key PTI signaling components.

PRJNA599395	Involvement of Arabidopsis BIG protein in cell death mediated by Myo-Inositol homeostasis (thale cress)	"Programmed cell death (PCD) is essential for several aspects of plant life. We previously identified the mips1 mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, which is deficient for the enzyme catalyzing myo-inositol synthesis, that displays light-dependent formation of lesions on leaves due to Salicylic Acid (SA) over-accumulation. Rationale of this work was to identify novel regulators of plant PCD using a genetic approach.
A screen for secondary mutations that abolish the mips1 PCD phenotype identified a mutation in the BIG gene, encoding a factor of unknown molecular function that was previously shown to play pleiotropic roles in plant development and defence. Physiological analyses showed that BIG is required for lesion formation in mips1 via SA-dependant signalling. big mutations partly rescued transcriptomic and metabolomics perturbations as stress-related phytohormones homeostasis.
In addition, since loss of function of the ceramide synthase LOH2 was not able to abolish cell death induction in mips1, we show that PCD induction is not fully dependent of sphingolipid accumulation as previously suggested.
Our results provide further insights into the role of the BIG protein in the control of MIPS1-dependent cell death and also into the impact of sphingolipid homeostasis in this pathway.

PRJNA600990	PAMP-triggered genetic reprogramming involves widespread alternative transcription initiation and an immediate transcription factor wave (thale cress)	"Immune responses triggered by pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) are key to pathogen defense, but drivers and stabilizers of the growth-to-defense genetic reprogramming remain incompletely understood in plants. Here, we report a time-course study of the establishment of PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI) using cap analysis of gene expression. We show that around 15% of all transcription start sites (TSSs) rapidly induced during PTI define alternative transcription initiation events. From these, we identify clear examples of regulatory TSS change via alternative inclusion of target peptides or domains in encoded proteins, or of upstream open reading frames in mRNA leader sequences. We also find that 60% of PAMP response genes respond earlier than previously thought. In particular, a cluster of rapidly and transiently PAMP-induced genes is enriched in transcription factors (TFs) whose functions, previously associated with biological processes as diverse as abiotic stress adaptation and stem cell activity, appear to converge on growth restriction. Furthermore, examples of known potentiators of PTI, in one case under direct mitogen-activated protein kinase control, support the notion that the rapidly induced TFs could constitute direct links to PTI signaling pathways and drive gene expression changes underlying establishment of the immune state.

PRJNA601526	PHOTOTROPIN 1 and 2 regulate photosynthesis and UV-induced oxidative stress and cell death (thale cress)	"Phototropins are plasma membrane‐associated photoreceptors of blue light. Arabidopsis thaliana genome has two genes, PHOT1 and PHOT2, encoding two phototropins that mediate phototropism, chloroplast positioning and stomatal opening. They are well characterized in terms of photomorphogenetic processes, but so far little was known about their involvement in photosynthesis and response to stress factors triggering oxidative stress and cell death. This work fills the gap in our understanding of PHOT1 and PHOT2 involvement in these processes. We used UV-C treatment to promote oxidative stress and cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type (Col-0 gl1), phot1, phot2 and phot1/phot2 mutants. Using RNAseq we identified genes differentially expressed in phot mutants, in comparison to the wild-type, in both non-stress conditions and after UV-C stress.

PRJNA601525	Novel Role of JAC1 in Influencing Photosynthesis, Stomatal Conductance, and Photooxidative Stress Signalling Pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Regulation of light absorption under variable light conditions is essential to optimize photosynthetic and acclimatory processes in plants. Light energy absorbed in excess has a damaging effect on chloroplasts and can lead to cell death. Therefore, plants have evolved protective mechanisms against excess excitation energy that include chloroplast accumulation and avoidance responses. One of the proteins involved in facilitating chloroplast movements in Arabidopsis thaliana is the J domain-containing protein required for chloroplast accumulation response 1 (JAC1). The function of JAC1 relates to the chloroplast actin filaments appearance and disappearance. So far, the role of JAC1 was studied mainly in terms of chloroplasts photorelocation. Here, we demonstrate that the function of JAC1 is more complex, since it influences the composition of photosynthetic pigments, the efficiency of photosynthesis, and the CO2 uptake rate. JAC1 has positive effect on water use efficiency (WUE) by reducing stomatal aperture and water vapor conductance. Importantly, we show that the stomatal aperture regulation is genetically coupled with JAC1 activity. In addition, our data demonstrate that JAC1 is involved in the fine-tuning of H2O2 foliar levels, antioxidant enzymes activities and cell death after UV-C photooxidative stress. This work uncovers a novel function for JAC1 in affecting photosynthesis, CO2 uptake, and photooxidative stress responses.

PRJNA601788	The characterization of Mediator12 and 13 as conditional positive gene regulators in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Mediator is a multi-protein complex which facilitates the initial steps of gene transcription. Mediator 12 (MED12) and MED13 are components of a module that reversibly associates with the core Mediator complex, and both positively and negatively regulates gene expression. Here, in an Arabidopsis mutant screen for factors required for morc1 de-repressed gene expression, we identified MED12 and MED13 as positive gene regulators, both of which contribute broadly to morc1 de-repressed gene expression. Both MED12 and MED13 are preferentially required for the expression of genes lacking active chromatin marks, a chromatin signature shared with morc1 re-activated loci. We further discovered that MED12 tends to interact with genes that are responsive to environmental stimuli, including light and radiation. We demonstrate that the light-induced transient gene expression depends on MED12, and is accompanied by a concomitant increase in MED12 enrichment during induction. In contrast, the steady-state expression level of these genes showed little dependence on MED12, suggesting that MED12 is primarily required to aid the expression of genes in transition from non-active to active states.
Overall design: The dataset contain 50 RNAseq samples, and 51 ChIPseq samples.

Consistently, the tcx5/tcx6 double mutant showed enhanced cell proliferation, enlarged organ size, and increased genome-wide methylation. This study reveals how maintenance of DNA methylation is coordinated with cell division to prevent genomic hypermethylation.

PRJNA602727	Conserved Arabidopsis response to oviposition and crude egg extract treatment (thale cress)	"Although a seemingly harmless developmental stage of herbivores, insect eggs trigger efficient plant defenses that include necrosis, callus formation, accumulation of ovicidal compounds and release of volatiles to attract egg predators. The large white butterfly Pieris brassicae deposits batches of 20-30 eggs onto Arabidopsis leaves, causing a large transcriptional reprograming that is drastically distinct from the expression profile triggered by larval feeding. Also, P. brassicae eggs induce localized cell death, accumulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and salicylic acid (SA), and expression of PTI-related genes, suggesting that egg-associated molecular patterns (EAMPs) activate a response that is similar to the response induced by microbial pathogens. We previously reported that a crude P. brassicae egg extract (EE, soluble fraction from crushed eggs) induced similar responses as oviposition, including ROS and SA accumulation, cell death and defense gene induction. In order to compare oviposition and EE treatment at the transcriptome level, we analyzed changes in transcipt abundance with P. brassicae EE or after natural oviposition. After 5 days, hundreds of genes were significantly upregulated by each treatment and their induction was highly similar between treatments. This conserved transcriptomic signature thus strongly supports our previous observations that oviposition and EE treatment trigger comparable responses in Arabidopsis.
Overall design: For experiments with natural oviposition, 15 plants were placed in a 60 x 60 x 60 cm tent containing approximately 30 Pieris brassicae butterflies. After 24 h, four plants containing one egg batch on two leaves were placed in a growth chamber for 4 days. Just before hatching, eggs were gently removed with a forceps. For egg extract application, 2 x 2 µl of egg extract were spotted under the surface of each of two leaves of each treated plant. Four plants were treated with egg extract for 5 days. Treated or oviposited leaves were harvested and quickly stored in liquid N2. Untreated plants were used as controls. Total RNA from 3 biologically independent experiments was extracted using an RNeasy® plant mini kit (Qiagen). DNase treatment was added to the protocol. For cDNA synthesis, RNA samples were purified by NaAC 3M and EtOH precipitation. Library were synthetized from 500 ng of purified total RNA using the TrueSeq stranded mRNA kit (Illumina).

PRJNA605023	New insights of Arabidopsis transcriptome complexity revealed by direct sequencing of native RNAs (thale cress)	"The transcriptome profiles of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana have been extensively studied and charcaterised under different developmental and physiological conditions. However, most of these “RNA-sequencing” datasets have been generated using the sequencing of reverse-transcribed cDNAs from mRNAs that have a relatively short read length. Here, we performed direct RNA sequencing using the latest Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) with unusual read length. We demonstrate that the complexity of the A. thaliana transcriptomes has been under-estimated. The ONT direct RNA sequencing technology identified transcript isoforms at a vegetative (14 day old seedlings, stage 1.04) and a reproductive stage (stage 6.00-6)  when 10% of the flowers had opened. In-house software called TrackCluster was used to determine alternative transcription initiation (ATI), possible alternative polyadenylation (APA), poly(A) length, alternative splicing (AS), and fusion transcripts. Tombo software was used to detect RNA base modifications. More than 38,500 novel transcript isoforms were identified, including six categories of fusion-transcripts which may result from differential RNA processing mechanisms. Fusion-transcripts are prone to mis-assembly by sequencing with short reads using next-generation-sequencing (NGS). These new transcript isoforms provide important additions to the annotated Arabidopsis genome. The power of ONT in detecting RNA modifications was demonstrated by characterisation of the modifications between mobile mRNAs and total mRNAs. The mobile mRNAs were enriched in m5C modifications, which is consistent with a recent finding that m5C modification in mRNAs is crucial for their long-distance movement. In summary, ONT direct RNA sequencing greatly enhances the identification of novel RNA transcript isoforms and RNA base modifications.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana col-0 seeds were surface sterilized with 50% commercial bleach and 0.01% Triton X-100 for 10 minutes, then washed 5 times with sterilized H2O. The sterilized seeds were sown on ½ MS plate with 1% sucrose and 0.6% Agar (sigma, cat#: A1296). Stratification at 4ºC for 48 hours, then placed in a growth chamber with 16h light/8h dark for 14 days. The 14-day seedlings were harvested (two biological replicates, each with one gram) for RNA extraction. Some seedlings were transplanted into soil for floral buds, the soil-based Arabidopsis seedlings were also treated with photoperiod of 16h light/8h dark. After another three-week growing, floral buds from plants equals to principal growth stage 6.0 to 6.1 were harvested, and they were immediately immersed in a foil boat full of liquid nitrogen in a relative larger liquid nitrogen container. Two Harvested biological replicates were frozen at -80degree freezer till RNA isolation. Total RNAs from Arabidopsis seedlings and floral buds were isolated with Trizol according to manufacturer’s instruction. The extracted total RNAs were then treated with Dnase I (NEB CAT#:M0303).

Following stimulation with ABA in Arabidopsis, we performed RNA-seq and small RNA-seq simultaneously at consecutive time points, and found that miRNAs respond rapidly under stress condition. Further functional analyses revealed that miRNAs classified according to different response time points play a role by binding different target genes. Systematic analysis including the static network of TF-target, TF-miRNA, miRNA-target and the time series DEGs and DE-miRNAs revealed a miRNA-mRNA dynamic regulatory network. We found that miRNAs in miRNA-containing feed-forward loops (M-FFLs) could enhance co-expression and crosstalks between different FFLs of network. Additionally, the differential transcript usage (DTU) and differential alternative splicing (DAS) analysis increased regulatory diversity between miRNA and its target genes.

PRJNA607298	A dynamic pattern of local auxin sources is required for root regeneration (thale cress)	"Following removal of its stem cell niche, the root meristem can regenerate by recruitment of remnant cells from the stump. Regeneration is initiated by rapid accumulation of auxin near the injury site but the source of this auxin is unknown. Here, we show that auxin accumulation arises from the activity of multiple auxin biosynthetic sources that are newly specified near the cut site and that their continuous activity is required for the regeneration process. Auxin synthesis is highly localized and PIN-mediate transport is dispensable for auxin accumulation and tip regeneration. Roots lacking the activity of the regeneration competence factor ERF115, or that are dissected at a zone of low-regeneration potential, fail to activate local auxin sources. Remarkably, restoring auxin supply is sufficient to confer regeneration capacity to these recalcitrant tissues. We suggest that regeneration competence relies on the ability to specify new local auxin sources in a precise spatio-temporal pattern.

By in vivo and in vitro analyses, we demonstrated that FHA2 directly binds to RLT1 and RLT2, two redundant subunits of the ISWI complex in Arabidopsis. A reduced-fertility phenotype was observed in both the fha2 and rlt1/2 mutant plants and the phenotype was ascribed to overgrowth of the pistil during the floral development. However, the early-flowering phenotype of the rlt1/2 mutant was not shared by the fha2 mutant. Consistently, our RNA-seq analysis indicated that the fha2 mutant affects a subset of rlt1/2-regulated genes but not genes involved in the regulation of flowering time.

PRJNA608263	Alterations in the transcriptome and translatome profiles of Arabidopsis pollen germinated under heat stress (thale cress)	"Plant reproduction is one key biological process very sensitive to heat stress and, as a consequence, enhanced global warming imposes serious threats to sustain food safety worldwide. In this work we have focused on the molecular impact that high temperature conditions impose on gene expression of Arabidopsis pollen germinated in vitro. We have used a high-resolution ribosome profiling technology to provide, for the first time, a comprehensive study of how both the transcriptome and the translatome of germinated pollen respond to the increase in temperature. Although heat shock responses operate properly under high temperature conditions, we have uncovered important alterations under elevated temperature regimes down-regulating essential processes linked to cation/proton exchange and to carbohydrate/cation symport transport. These alterations provide molecular explanations to the dramatic alterations of pollen tube growth under heat stress. Overall a high correlation between transcriptional and translational responses to high temperature was found, but specific regulations at the translational level are also present in pollen subjected to temperature challenging conditions.
Overall design: Riboprofiling analysis was performed for Arabidopsis thaliana in vitro germinated pollen at permissive and restrictive temperatures (24°C 35°C respectively). Less..."

PRJNA608657	Reprogramming of bacterial and plant sulfur metabolisms in Enterobacter sp. SA187-induced plant salt stress tolerance (thale cress)	"Although some mechanisms are known how plant growth beneficial bacteria help plants to grow under stressful conditions, we still know little how the metabolism of host plants and bacteria is coordinated during the establishment of functional interaction. In the present work, using single and dual transcriptomics, we studied the reprograming of metabolic and signaling pathways of Enterobacter sp. SA187 with Arabidopsis thaliana during the change from free-living to endophytic host-microbe interaction. We could identify major changes in primary and secondary metabolic pathways in both the host and bacteria upon interaction, with an important role of the sulfur metabolism and retrograde signaling in mediating plant resistance to salt stress. Also, we studied the effect of SA187 endogenous compounds and its role on sulfur metabolism and consequently salt tolerance. These data should help future research in the field of beneficial plant-microbe interactions for developing sophisticated strategies to improve agriculture of crops under adverse environmental conditions.

Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 seeds were surface sterilized 10 min in 70% EtOH + 0.05% sodium dodecyl sulfate on a shaker, washed 2 times in 96% EtOH and air dried. Sterilized seeds were sown on half-strength Murashige and Skoog (Murashige and Skoog, 1962) (MS) agar plates (0.9% agar) inoculated with SA187 for SA187 treated samples, and other treatments were directly stratified for 2 days at 4˚C in darkness. After stratification, seeds were germinated vertically for 5 days at 22 °C and 16/8 h light/dark cycle with photon flux density 150 μmol m-2 s-1 during the light cycle. Uniformly germinated seedlings with 1 cm root length were then transferred and grown vertically in 1/2MS with 100 mM NaCl plates, and for ACC (1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid, Sigma) and KMBA (2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid, Sigma) treatments 100 nM dilutions with water of each substance were added into pre-cooled ½ MS agar medium together with 100 mM NaCl, and all seedlings for all treatments were grown for another 16 days. Six seedlings were transferred to each plate. To prepare the SA187 inoculum, overnight bacterial cultures in LB broth (Sigma) were harvested, centrifuged 15 min at 3,000 rpm, washed twice in liquid MS and resuspended in MS to a final OD600 = 0.2.

PRJNA609343	H3.1K27me1 maintains transcriptional silencing and genome stability by preventing GCN5-mediated histone acetylation (thale cress)	"In plants, genome stability is maintained during DNA replication by the H3K27 methyltransferases ATXR5 and ATXR6, which catalyze the deposition of H3K27me1 on the replication-dependent H3.1 variant. Loss of H3.1K27me1 in atxr5 atxr6 mutants leads to heterochromatin defects, including transcriptional de-repression and genomic instability, but the molecular mechanisms involved remain largely unknown. In this study, we identified the conserved histone acetyltransferase GCN5 as a mediator of transcriptional de-repression and genomic instability in the absence of H3.1K27me1. GCN5 is part of a SAGA-like complex in plants and requires ADA2b and CHR6 to mediate the heterochromatic defects of atxr5 atxr6 mutants. Our results show that GCN5 acetylates multiple lysine residues on H3.1 variants, but that H3.1K27 and H3.1K36 play key roles in inducing genomic instability in the absence of H3.1K27me1. Overall, this work reveals a key molecular role for H3.1K27me1 in maintaining genome stability by preventing GCN5-dependent histone acetylation in plants.

PRJNA609704	Molecular plant responses to combined abiotic stresses put a spotlight on unknown and abundant genes (thale cress)	"Environmental stresses such as drought, heat and salinity limit plant development and agricultural productivity. While individual stresses have been studied extensively, much less is known about the molecular interaction of responses to multiple stresses. To address this problem, we investigated molecular responses of Arabidopsis thaliana to single, double, and triple combinations of salt, osmotic, and heat stresses. A metabolite profiling analysis indicated the production of specific compatible solutes depending on the nature of the stress applied. We found that in combination with other stresses, heat has a dominant effect on global gene expression and metabolites level patterns. Treatments that include heat stress lead to strongly reduced transcription of genes coding for abundant photosynthetic proteins and proteins regulating the cell life cycle, while genes involved in protein degradation are upregulated. Under combined stress conditions, the plants shifted their metabolism to a survival state characterized by low productivity. Our work provides molecular evidence for the dangers for plant productivity and future world food security posed by heat waves resulting from global warming. We highlight candidate genes, many of which are functionally uncharacterized, for engineering plant abiotic stress tolerance.

PRJNA611622	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of Wild Type, arr1, and AOE Transcriptomes (thale cress)	"Purpose: The goals of this study are to identify the downstream regulated genes of ARR1.
Methods: RNA was extracted from wild-type, arr1 single mutant, and AOE root explants at the nascent SAM formation stage. Library construction and RNA-Seq were performed by Biomarker Co. (www.biomarker.com.cn, Beijing, China). DESeq and the Q value were used to identify differentially transcribed genes (DTGs). Differential transcription was inferred by applying a false discovery rate threshold of 0.001 and the |log2 Ratio| ≥ 1. Functional categorization was inferred from a BLAST search of the non-redundant GenBank (/genbank/), KEGG Pathway (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/pathway.html), and UniProt protein databases (http://www.uniprot.org/), and was further analyzed by the Gene Ontology (http://geneontology.org/) method.
Results: In the transcriptomes of arr1 vs. wild-type explants, we detected 177 up- and 260 downregulated DTGs, and in the AOE vs. wild-type transcriptomes, we detected 129 and 6 DTGs, respectively. The pathways involved in hormone signal transduction and indole alkaloid synthesis were well represented among the DTGs in arr1 vs. wild type. These DTGs also included genes involved in auxin transport and signaling, as well as IAA17, an Aux/IAA repressor gene, which was downregulated in arr1 root explants.
Conclusions: Our study showed that IAA17 was downstream gene of ARR1 in root explants.

PRJNA611770	Advanced genomics identifies growth effectors for proteotoxic ER stress recovery in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Adverse environmental and pathophysiological situations can overwhelm the biosynthetic capacity of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), igniting a potentially lethal condition known as ER stress. ER stress results in growth reduction and the activation of a conserved cytoprotective signaling cascade, the unfolded protein response (UPR), to mitigate ER stress. As ER stress subsides, growth is resumed; however, despite a pivotal role of the UPR in growth restoration, the underlying mechanisms are yet unknown. To discover these, we undertook a genomics approach and mined the gene reprogramming roles of the two critical and conserved UPR modulators, basic leucine zipper28 (bZIP28) and bZIP60 in ER stress resolution. Through a coexpression-based network modeling and experimental validation, we identified key responsive genes acting downstream of the UPR bZIP-transcription factors (bZIP-TF), and demonstrated their roles in organ growth during recovery from ER stress. Our analyses have also set up a novel pipeline for functional gene discovery in ER stress resolution with broad applicability across multicellular eukaryotes.

PRJNA612487	The histone variant H2A.W and linker histone H1 co-regulate heterochromatin accessibility and DNA methylation (thale cress)	"In flowering plants, heterochromatin is demarcated by the histone variant H2A.W, elevated levels of the linker histone H1, and specific epigenetic modifications, such as high levels of DNA methylation at both CG and non-CG sites. How H2A.W regulates heterochromatin organization and interacts with other heterochromatic features is unclear. Here, we create an h2a.w null mutant via CRISPR-Cas9, h2a.w-2, to analyze the in vivo function of H2A.W. We find that H2A.W antagonizes deposition of H1 at heterochromatin and that non-CG methylation and accessibility are moderately decreased in h2a.w-2 heterochromatin. Compared to H1 loss alone, combined loss of H1 and H2A.W greatly increases accessibility and facilitates non-CG DNA methylation in heterochromatin, suggesting co-regulation of heterochromatic features by H2A.W and H1. Our results suggest that H2A.W helps maintain optimal heterochromatin accessibility and DNA methylation by promoting chromatin compaction together with H1, while also inhibiting excessive H1 incorporation.
Overall design: ChIP-seq of a large number of modified and unmodified histones (H2A, H2A.Z, H2A.X, H3, H3K9me1, H3K9me2, H3K27me1, H1) in (WT) and triple H2A.W-null (h2a.w-2) plants to examine how the chromatin environment is perturbed upon loss of H2A.W. This was used in conjunction with ATAC-seq and bisulfite-seq of WT, h2a.w-2, double H1-null (h1) and quintuple H1 and H2A.W null (h1 h2a.w-2) to examine the relationship between H1 and H2A.W in regulating heterochromatin. Total (rRNA-depleted) RNA was also sequenced in WT and h2a.w-2 to identify any changes in gene or TE expression. Two replicates of ChIP-seq, ATAC-seq and bisulfite-see experiments were performed, while RNA-seq was done in triplicate.

PRJNA613599	Transcriptome profiling of Arabidopsis tac1 and lazy1 mutant shoot tips under normal and gravistimulated conditions (thale cress)	"This data is was generated in connection with a study on the  'Opposing influences of TAC1 and LAZY1 on Lateral Shoot Orientation in Arabidopsis'. RNA was extracted from individual shoot tips from wild type (Columbia; Col), tac1, and lazy1 plants that experienced either 0 or 45 minutes of gravistimulation by 90-degree reorientation. The summary of the entire project is as follows: TAC1 and LAZY1 are members of a gene family that regulates lateral shoot orientation in plants. TAC1 promotes outward orientations in response to light, while LAZY1 promotes upward shoot orientations in response to gravity via altered auxin transport. We performed genetic, molecular, and biochemical assays to investigate possible interactions between these genes. In Arabidopsis they were expressed in similar tissues and double mutants revealed the wide-angled lazy1 branch phenotype, indicating it is epistatic to the tac1 shoot phenotype. Surprisingly, the lack of TAC1 did not influence gravitropic shoot curvature responses. Combined, these results suggest TAC1 might negatively regulate LAZY1 to promote outward shoot orientations. However, additional results revealed that TAC1- and LAZY1 influence on shoot orientation is more complex than a simple direct negative regulatory pathway. Transcriptomes of Arabidopsis tac1 and lazy1 mutants compared to wild type under normal and gravistimulated conditions revealed few overlapping differentially expressed genes. Overexpression of each gene did not result in major branch angle differences. Shoot tip hormone levels were similar between tac1, lazy1, and Col, apart from exceptionally elevated levels of salicylic acid in lazy1. The data presented here provide a foundation for future study of TAC1 and LAZY1 regulation of shoot architecture.
Overall design: Arabidopsis plants containing only a single inflorescence shoot, with a height of ~15-18 cm, and no more than 3 lateral shoots (each no larger than ~1 cm) were used for expression profiling. Prior to collection, plants were left for at least 12 hours in a dark chamber with wooden stakes to support primary shoots to ensure they would be vertical at the time of collection. Primary shoot tips from upright (t0) plants and plants after 45 minutes of gravistimulation in the dark by a 90° reorientation (t45 plants) were collected on the same day. The t0 collections were at ~10 AM and t45 collections were at ~10:45 AM (having been reoriented at ~10 AM).

Applying 4SEE to a collection of confirmed T-DNA lines revealed previously unmapped T-DNA insertions and chromosomal rearrangements such as inversions and translocations. Uncovering such events in feasible, robust and cost-effective manners by 4SEE in any plant of interest have implications for accurate annotation and phenotypic characterization of T-DNA insertion mutants and transgene expression in basic science applications as well as for plant biotechnology.
Overall design: 4C-seq was performed on WT, SALK_011436, SALK_009469, SALK_041474, SALK_064627, SALK_005512 from the SALK stock, and CS68932 from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center (ABRC) were used in this study.  There are 118 samples, as follows: three endogenous genes (two replicas each), four SALK lines in a gradient of template amounts: six samples of SALK_063720 and SALK_064627, five samples of SALK_011436 and seven samples of SALK_005512. The remaining SALK lines have 1 sample each. Seventy-two files are on the ADF viewpoint (CS68932), with a gradient of template amounts and reads. The remaining 14 samples are seven viewpoints measured in WT or CS68932 plant, which map the chromosomal rearrangements. Less..."

PRJNA615651	Endosperm and maternal-specific expression of EIN2 affects endosperm cellularization and seed size in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Seed size is related to plant evolution and crop yield and is affected by genetic mutations, imprinting, and genome dosage. Imprinting is a widespread epigenetic phenomenon in mammals and flowering plants. ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2 (EIN2) encodes a membrane protein that links the ethylene perception to transcriptional regulation. Interestingly, during seed development EIN2 is maternally-expressed in Arabidopsis and maize, but the role of EIN2 in seed development is unknown. Here we show that EIN2 is expressed specifically in the endosperm, and the maternal-specific EIN2 expression affects temporal regulation of endosperm cellularization. As a result, seed size increases in the genetic cross using the ein2 mutant as the maternal parent or in the ein2 mutant. The maternal-specific expression of EIN2 in the endosperm is controlled by DNA methylation but not by H3K27me3 or by ethylene and several ethylene pathway genes tested. RNA-seq analysis in the endosperm isolated by laser-capture microdissection show upregulation of many endosperm-expressed genes such as AGAMOUS-LIKEs (AGLs) in the ein2 mutant or when the maternal EIN2 allele is not expressed. EIN2 does not interact with DNA and may act through ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3), a DNA binding protein present in sporophytic tissues, to activate target genes like AGLs, which in turn mediate temporal regulation of endosperm cellularization and seed size. These results provide mechanistic insights into endosperm and maternal-specific expression of EIN2 on endosperm cellularization and seed development, which could help improve seed production in plants and crops.

PRJNA616378	NTRC controls chloroplast redox homeostasis through the regulation of the redox balance of 2-Cys Prxs in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Thiol-dependent redox regulation is essential for the rapid adaptation of chloroplast metabolism to unpredictable changes of light intensity. The disulfide reductase activity of thioredoxins (Trxs), which relies on photo-reduced ferredoxin (Fdx) and a Fdx-dependent Trx reductase (FTR), constitutes the Fdx-FTR-Trxs system, which links chloroplast redox regulation to light. In addition, chloroplasts harbor an NADPH-dependent Trx reductase (NTR) with a joint Trx domain, NTRC. The activity of these two redox systems is integrated by the balance of the hydrogen peroxide scavenging enzyme 2-Cys peroxiredoxin (2-Cys Prx), which thus plays a key role in maintaining the reducing capacity of chloroplast Trxs in response to light intensity. Based on the severe phenotype of mutant lines lacking NTRC, it is clear that this enzyme plays an essential role in chloroplast redox homeostasis. However, whether the function of NTRC depends on its capacity of reduce 2-Cys Prxs or has additional targets remains unknown. Here, we have addressed this issue by a comparative analysis of the triple mutant of Arabidopsis thaliana, ntrc-2cpab, simultaneously lacking 2-Cys Prxs and NTRC, and the double mutant 2cpab lacking 2-Cys Prxs. The phenotype of the ntrc-2cpab mutant is indistinguishable of the 2cpab mutant, as shown by growth rate, photosynthesis performance, light-dependent redox regulation of enzyme activity and comparative transcriptomics based RNA-Seq. Based on these results, we propose that the function of NTRC in chloroplast redox homeostasis is exerted by the regulation of the redox balance of 2-Cys Prxs rather than by the direct reduction of additional targets.
Overall design: Eight-week-old short-day grown wild-type, 2cpab and ntrc-2cpab plants were randomly selected and young rosette leaves collected  after  2  hours  of  illumination  at  125  μE  m-2 s-1.

PRJNA620359	N6-methyladenosine and RNA secondary structure affect transcript stability and translation during systemic salt stress in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"After transcription, a messenger RNA (mRNA)  is further post-transcriptionally regulated by several features including RNA secondary structure and covalent RNA modifications (specifically N6-methyladenosine, m6A). Both RNA secondary structure and m6A have been demonstrated to regulate mRNA stability and translation as well as have been independently linked to plant response to excess salt concentrations in the soil. However, the effect of m6A on regulating RNA secondary structure and the combinatorial interplay between these two RNA features during salt stress response has yet to be studied. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary structure during systemic salt stress. This analysis reveals that RNA secondary structure is highly dynamic during salt stress, which is independent of changes in RNA-protein interactions. Conversely, we find that m6A is anti-correlated with RNA secondary structure in a condition-specific manner, with salt-specific m6A resulting in a decrease in mRNA secondary structure during salt stress. Remarkably, we show that the combination of salt-specific m6A deposition and the associated loss of RNA secondary structure results in increases in mRNA stability and translation of transcripts encoding proteins involved in responses to abiotic stresses. In total, our comprehensive analyses reveal an important epitranscriptome, secondary structure-mediated post-transcriptional regulatory mechanism involved in plant long-term salt stress response and adaptation.

PRJNA497883	Dynamics of gene expression in single root cells of A. thaliana (thale cress)	"Here, we apply this approach to A. thaliana root cells to capture gene expression in 3,121 root cells. We analyze these data with Monocle 3, which orders single cell transcriptomes in an unsupervised manner and uses machine learning to reconstruct single-cell developmental trajectories along pseudotime. We identify hundreds of genes with cell-type-specific expression, with pseudotime analysis of several cell lineages revealing both known and novel genes that are expressed along a developmental trajectory. We identify transcription factor motifs that are enriched in early and late cells, together with the corresponding candidate transcription factors that likely drive the observed expression patterns. Finally, by applying heat stress to whole seedlings, we address the longstanding question of possible heterogeneity among cell types in the response to an abiotic stress. Although the response of canonical heat shock genes dominates expression across cell types, subtle but significant differences in other genes can be detected among cell types. Taken together, our results demonstrate that single-cell transcriptomics holds promise for studying plant development and plant physiology with unprecedented resolution

PRJNA625345	Transcriptome of Moesziomyces albugensis in response to different biotic factors (A. laibachii & SynCom) on A. thaliana leaves	"As the phyllosphere is a resource-limited niche, microbes have evolved different survival strategies by collaborating or competing with other organisms. This leads to the establishment of network structures which are stabilised by so-called microbial hub organisms. An already identified hub in the Arabidopsis thaliana phyllosphere is the oomycete pathogen Albugo laibachii. From wild Arabidopsis plants with white rust symptoms we isolated the basidiomycete yeast Moesziomyces albugensis, which is closely related to plant pathogenic smut fungi. It suppresses the infection of A. laibachii in lab experiments and inhibits growth of several bacterial phyllosphere members. The transcriptomic response of M. albugensis to presence of A. laibachii and bacterial SynCom members was investigated by using RNA sequencing. Interestingly, several genes encoding secretory proteins, mostly glycoside hydrolases and peptidases, are particularly induced upon interaction with A. laibachii.
Overall design: To analyze the response of M. albugensis to specific biotic interactions in the A. thaliana phyllosphere transcriptomic profiling of M. albugensis was done. Samples were treated as in A. laibachii infections. Members of the phyllosphere network were sprayed first onto the leaf surface and a stable community was established after 2 days. The samples were then challenged with A. laibachii and incubated at 0°C over night. 1 day after cold treatment (4 days after spraying of Moesziomyces) cells were peeled from the leaf surface by using liquid latex. To determine plant specific responses, we used an M. albugensis axenic culture and compared its transcriptome to M. albugensis being alone on the plant surface. For on plant controls we used M. albugensis in one to one interactions with A. laibachii and the bacterial SynCom and compared them to the test condition of all being together on the plant surface.

PRJNA625566	RNA interference-independent reprogramming of DNA methylation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"DNA methylation is important for silencing transposable elements (TEs) in diverse eukaryotes including plants. In plant genomes, TEs are heavily methylated at cytosines of both CG and non-CG (or CH, where H can be A, T, or C) contexts. The role of RNA interference (RNAi) in establishing TE-specific DNA methylation has been extensively studied, although the significance of RNAi-independent pathways in DNA-methylation reprograming remains unexplored. Here, we directly investigated transgenerational de novo DNA methylation of TEs after the loss of DNA methylation. Our analyses identified very potent and precise RNAi-independent pathways for recovering CH methylation in most TE genes, or coding regions within TEs. Characterization of a small subset of TE genes that did not show CH methylation recovery revealed the impacts of H3K9 demethylation and replacement of histone H2A variants. These chromatin components are conserved between plants and animals and may contribute to chromatin reprograming in a conserved manner.

PRJNA626535	Relevance of Unfolded Protein Response to Spaceflight-Induced Transcriptional Reprogramming in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Plants are primary producers of food and oxygen on Earth and will likewise be indispensable to the establishment of large-scale sustainable ecosystems and human survival in space. To contribute to the understanding of how plants respond to spaceflight stresses, we examined the relevance of the unfolded protein response (UPR), a conserved signaling cascade that responds to a number of unfavorable environmental stresses, in the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana.  To do so, we compared the transcriptional responses of wild type and UPR-defective seedlings to spaceflight during the SpaceX-CRS12 mission to the International Space Station. We established that orbital culture substantially altered the expression of hundreds of stress related genes compared to ground control conditions. Although many of these genes were differentially regulated in the UPR mutants in the ground control conditions compared to wild type, their expression was largely equalized in all genotypes by flight. Our results have yielded new information on how plants respond to growth in orbit and support the hypothesis that spaceflight induces the activation of signaling pathways that compensate for the loss of UPR regulators in the control of downstream transcriptional regulatory networks.
Overall design: RNA-seq profiles of WT (Col-0) and various mutants of sensor genes for unfolded protein response in Arabidopsis seedlings in spaceflight compared to ground.

PRJNA628644	Ethylene modulates the dynamics of translation via GCN2 and EIN2 in Arabidopsis under submergence (thale cress)	"General translational repression is predicted as a key process to reduce energy consumption under hypoxia. We have previously showed that mRNA loading onto polysome is reduced in Arabidopsis under submergence. Here, we showed that plant stress activated GCN2 (general control nonderepressible 2) can phosphorylate eIF2a (Eukaryotic Initiation Factor 2a) in Arabidopsis under submergence, and this process is reversible after desubmergence. Compared to the wild-type, the reduction in polysome loading during submergence was less severe in the gcn2 mutant. Transgenic lines overexpressing GCN2 had more ATP and conferred better tolerance under submergence, suggesting that GCN2 might modulate the dynamics of translation to adjust the energy homeostasis under hypoxia. Interestingly, GCN2-eIF2a signaling was activated by ethylene under submergence. However, GCN2 activity was not affected in ein2-5 and eil1ein3 under submergence, suggesting that GCN2 activity was regulated by noncanonical ethylene signaling. In addition, the polysome loading was retained in both ein2-5 and etr1-1 under submergence, implying that ethylene modulated the dynamic translation under submergence via EIN2 and GCN2. Notably, our NGS analysis also demonstrated that EIN2 and GCN2 regulated the translation of 23 core hypoxia genes as well as 53% translational repressed genes under submergence. On the other hand, EIN2 and GCN2 also affected the expression of genes involved in hypoxic response, ethylene response, biotic stress and negative regulation of cytokinin signaling. Taken together, these demonstrated that entrapped ethylene triggers GCN2 and EIN2 to ensure the translation of stress required proteins under submergence and also provide a step stone for future investigation how eukaryotic cells modulate the translation to response for the changeable environments.

Here, we report that the steroid hormone brassinosteroids (BRs) play crucial roles in the transition from skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis by regulating chlorophyll biosynthesis to promote the greening of etiolated seedlings upon light exposure. Seedlings of BR-deficient mutant det2-1 accumulated excess protochlorophyllide when grown in darkness, resulting in photo-oxidative damage upon exposure to light. Conversely, the gain-of-function mutant bzr1-1D suppressed the protochlorophyllide-accumulated phenotype of det2-1, thereby promoting greening of etiolated seedlings. Genetic analysis indicated that phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) were required for BZR1-promoted seedlings greening. Furthermore, we revealed that the GROWTH REGULATING FACTOR 7 (GRF7) and GRF8 were induced by BZR1 and PIF4 to repress the chlorophyll biosynthesis and promote seedling greening. Suppression the functions of GRFs by overexpressing microRNA396a (miR396a) caused the high-accumulated photochlorophyllide in darkness and more serious photobleach upon light exposure. Additionally, BZR1, PIF4 and GRF7 interact with each other and precisely regulate the expression of chlorophyll biosynthetic genes. Our findings revealed an essential role of brassinosteroid in promoting seedling development and survival during the critical initial emergence of seedlings from subterranean darkness to sunlight.

(thale cress)	"CRISPR-based targeted modification of epigenetic marks is an important strategy to regulate the expression of genes and their associated phenotypes in plants and animals. The manipulation of DNA cytosine methylation is particularly attractive in plants since DNA methylation changes are often heritable in subsequent plant generations. Although plants have DNA methylation in all sequence contexts (CG, CHG, CHH, where H can be any nucleotide but G), methylation at symmetrical CG sites is the most important for gene silencing, and is also the most efficiently maintained through miotic and meiotic cell divisions. Thus, DNA methylation targeting tools that directly install CG methylation are highly desirable. Here we have developed two CRISPR-based CG specific targeted DNA methylation systems for plants using the DNA methyltransferase MQ1 (SssI) from the bacterium Mollicutes spiroplasma. To reduce off-target effects, we used a variant of the enzyme with reduced catalytic activity. We demonstrate that methylation added by MQ1 is highly target-specific and can be heritably maintained in the absence of the effector. These tools should be valuable both in crop engineering and in plant genetic research.
Overall design: This study evaluated two new CRISPR-based tools, MQ1v and SunTag-MQ1v, designed to target de novo DNA methylation in plants using MQ1, a CG-specific bacterial methyltransferase. These tools were targeted to the promoter of the gene FWA using three previously-characterized guide RNAs (Papikian et al. 2019).  MQ1v and SunTag-MQ1v were targeted to the FWA promoter in fwa epimutants to test whether they could establish DNA methylation over the promoter and affect FWA expression. Control plants were transformed with dMQ1, a version of MQ1v that has no catalytic activity. MQ1v efficiency was also evaluated in the absence of functional transcriptional (drm1 drm2 background) and post-transcriptional gene silencing (rdr6 background). Transformed plants and their descendants were evaluated by assessing FWA expression (qPCR or RNA-seq), and DNA methylation at the FWA promoter (bisulfite-PCR followed by sequencing, or BS-PCR) and genome-wide (bisulfite sequencing, pr BS-seq). BS-seq and/or BS-PCR was performed for individual transformed plants (T1) and/or their descendants (T2, T3, or T4, corresponding to second-, third-, and fourth-generation descendants of the T1 plants, respectively), as well as appropriate dMQ1, fwa and Col (wild-type) controls. RNA-seq experiments were performed in T4 plants in triplicate. Less..."

PRJNA631913	BIC1 acts as a transcriptional coactivator to promote brassinosteroid signaling and plant 14 1 growth (thale cress)	"The BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT 1 (BZR1) transcription factor family plays an essential role in plant brassinosteroid (BR) signaling, but the signaling mechanism through which BZR1 and its homologs cooperate with certain coactivators to facilitate transcription of target genes remains incompletely understood. In this study, we used an efficient protein interaction screening system to identify blue-light inhibitor of cryptochromes 1 (BIC1) as a new BZR1-interacting protein in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that BIC1 positively regulates BR signaling and acts as a transcriptional coactivator for BZR1-dependent activation of BR-responsive genes. Simultaneously, BIC1 interacts with the transcription factor PIF4 to synergistically and interdependently activate expression of downstream genes including PIF4 itself, and to promote plant growth. Chromatin immunoprecipitation assays demonstrate that BIC1 and BZR1/PIF4 interdependently associate with the promoters of common target genes. In addition, we show that the interaction between BIC1 and BZR1 is evolutionally conserved in the model monocot plant Triticum aestivum (bread wheat). Together, our results reveal mechanistic details of BR signaling mediated by a transcriptional activation module BIC1/BZR1/PIF4 and thus provide new insights into the molecular mechanisms underlying the integration of BR and light signaling in plants.
Overall design: Wild type Col-0 and BIC1-YFP seedlings grown under long-day conditions chamber for 10 days and were collected. Three replicates were prepared for each sample. RNA was extracted using an ethanol precipitation protocol and Trizol (Invitrogen) reagent. Libraries were constructed and further sequenced on Illumina HiSeq. 2000 platform (Illumina Inc., USA) with three independent biological replications for each sample.

Whether or how the major steps in miRNA biogenesis are coordinated is largely unknown. Here, we show that the plant TREX-2 complex promotes multiple steps in miRNA biogenesis, including transcription, processing and nuclear export. Core subunits of TREX-2, THP1 and SAC3A, interact and co-localize with RNA Polymerase II to promote the transcription of MIR genes in the nucleoplasm. TREX-2 interacts with the microprocessor component SERRATE and promotes the formation of Dicing bodies in the nucleoplasm. THP1 also interacts and co-localizes with a nucleoporin protein NUP1 at the nuclear envelope. NUP1 and THP1 promote the nuclear export of miRNAs and AGO1. These results suggest that TREX-2 coordinates the transcription, processing and export steps in miRNA biogenesis to ensure efficient miRNA production.

PRJNA629080	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Elucidating the role of OsMyb-R1 in Arabidopsis under drought stress using RNA-Seq approach among over-expressing and wild-type plants	In this study, we targeted Myb TF to functionally characterize its role in imparting abiotic stress tolerance, particularly in drought, using the gain of function approach. Ectopic expression of OsMyb-R1 in Arabidopsis resulted in the drought/PEG tolerant phenotype, while wild-type plants could not manage to grow efficiently under water deficit stresses. Comparative transcriptome analysis of wild type (Col-0) and OsMyb-R1 overexpressing seedling and in vitro experiments documented the enhanced expression of several stress-responsive genes, hormones related genes as well as other regulatory genes. In the present study, we observed differential expression patterns of auxin, ABA, and salicylic acid metabolism and responsive genes. In vitro analysis also suggests the active involvement of these hormones during drought stress in OsMyb-R1 expressing Arabidopsis as compared to wild-type. Overall, the present study put forward OsMyb-R1, which is playing an essential role in augmenting drought stress tolerance of over-expressing transgenic lines by modifying molecular signaling, internal cellular homeostasis, and root morphology.

PRJNA605520	Transcription Factor GmWRKY142 Confers Cadmium Resistance by Up-regulating the Cadmium Tolerance 1-like Genes	Cadmium (Cd) is a widespread pollutant that is toxic to living organisms. Previous studies have identified certain WRKY transcription factors, which confer Cd tolerance in different plant species. In the present study, we have identified 29 Cd-responsive WRKY genes in Edamame [Glycine max (L.) Merr.], and confirmed that 26 of those GmWRKY genes were up-regulated, while 3 were down-regulated. We have also cloned the novel, positively regulated GmWRKY142 gene from soybean and investigated its regulatory mechanism in Cd tolerance. GmWRKY142 was highly expressed in the root, drastically up-regulated by Cd, localized in the nucleus, and displayed transcriptional activity. The overexpression of GmWRKY142 in Arabidopsis thaliana and soybean hairy roots significantly enhanced Cd tolerance and lead to extensive transcriptional reprogramming of stress-responsive genes. ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 encoding cadmium tolerance 1 were induced in overexpression lines. Further analysis showed that GmWRKY142 activated the transcription of ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 by directly binding to the W-box element in their promoters. In addition, the functions of GmCDT1-1 and GmCDT1-2, responsible for decreasing Cd uptake, were validated by heterologous expression in A. thaliana. Our combined results have determined GmWRKYs to be newly discovered participants in response to Cd stress, and have confirmed that GmWRKY142 directly targets ATCDT1, GmCDT1-1, and GmCDT1-2 to decrease Cd uptake and positively regulate Cd tolerance. The GmWRKY142-GmCDT1-1/2 cascade module provides a potential strategy to lower Cd accumulation in Edamame. Less...

PRJNA610830	Transcription factor-mediated activities of enhancer lincRNAs in flower development	Genome-wide efforts revealed have identified a large number of long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs), though their potential functions remain largely enigmatic. The floral meristem identity factor APETALA1 (AP1) controls the initiation of flower morphogenesis. Here, we used the AP1-based system for synchronized floral induction in Arabidopsis to identify 4106 flower-related long intergenic RNAs (lincRNAs) with distinct features compared to protein coding genes. Flower-related lincRNAs are typically associated with functional enhancers which are bi-directionally transcribed and are associated with diverse functional gene modules related to floral organ development based on co-expression network analysis. The master regulatory transcription factors (TFs) AP1 and SEPALLATA3 (SEP3) bind to lincRNA-associated enhancers. Binding of these TFs is correlated with increase in lincRNA transcription and chromatin accessibility at enhancers, presumably followed by activation of target genes. For example, the lincRNA Aralnc.19175 (designated previously as LINC-AP2) spanning two enhancers bound by AP1 and SEP3 shows increasing activity during flower development. The enhanced expression of the lincRNA is coupled to increasing accessibility of the two corresponding enhancers, thereby potentially contributing to activation of the neighboring AP2 gene. We hypothesize that enhancer-associated lincRNA expression is functionally linked with TF activity in floral gene regulation. Less...

PRJEB28958	TERMINAL FLOWER 1 functions as a mobile transcriptional co-factor in the Arabidopsis thaliana shoot apical meristem	The floral transition is a critical step in the plant life cycle and several mechanisms control this finely orchestrated process. TERMINAL FLOWER 1 (TFL1) is a floral repressor and close relative of the florigen, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). During floral transition TFL1 expression is up-regulated in the apex to maintain the indeterminate growth of the shoot apical meristem (SAM). Both TFL1 and FT are mobile proteins, but they move in different ways. FT moves from the leaves to the SAM while TFL1 appears to move within the SAM. The importance of TFL1 movement for its function in the regulation of flowering time and shoot indeterminacy and its molecular function are still largely unclear. Our results indicate that the TFL1 protein moves from its place of expression in the centre of the SAM all the way to the meristem layer L1 where it regulates the floral transition. ChIP-seq and RNA-seq demonstrate that TFL1 functions as a co-transcription factor that associates with and regulates the expression of hundreds of genes. Some putative direct targets of TFL1 have been identified, opening the possibility to discover new roles for TFL1 in the regulation of floral transition and inflorescence development. Less...

PRJEB33339	Specific functions for Mediator complex subunits from different modules in the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to abiotic stress	Adverse environmental conditions, including heat, cold, high salinity and drought, are detrimental to plant growth and development. Acclimation to these abiotic stress conditions involves activation of signaling pathways which often results in changes in gene expression via networks of transcription factors (TFs). Mediator is a highly conserved co-regulator complex and an essential component of the transcriptional machinery in eukaryotes. Some Mediator subunits have been implicated in stress-responsive signaling pathways; however, much remains unknown regarding the role of plant Mediator in abiotic stress responses. Here, we use RNA-seq to analyze the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to heat, cold and salt stress conditions. We identify a set of common abiotic stress regulons and describe the sequential and combinatorial nature of TFs involved in their transcriptional regulation. Furthermore, we identify stress-specific roles for the Mediator subunits MED9, MED16, MED18 and CDK8, and putative TFs connecting them to different stress signaling pathways. Our data also indicate different modes of action for subunits or modules of Mediator at the same gene loci, including a co-repressor function for MED16 prior to stress. These results illuminate a poorly understood but important player in the transcriptional response of plants to abiotic stress and identify target genes and mechanisms as a prelude to further biochemical characterization Less...

PRJEB33240	Characterization of Arabidopsis PMD MAIL and MAIL1 pathwayPlant mobile domain proteins MAIN and MAIL1 interact with the phosphatase PP7L to regulate gene expression and silence transposable elements.	Transposable elements (TEs) are DNA repeats that must remain silenced to ensure cell integrity. Several epigenetic pathways including DNA methylation and histone modifications are involved in the silencing of TEs and in the regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis, additional pathways such as the Microrchidia 1 (MORC1)/MORC6 pathway are required for TE silencing. Recently, TE-derived plant mobile domain (PMD) proteins have been related to TE silencing but also genome stability, and control of developmental processes. Thus, it has been proposed that PMDs could be involved in the regulation of gene transcription. Using a forward genetic screen in Arabidopsis, we found that the PMD protein MAINTENANCE OF MERISTEMS (MAIN) act synergistically and redundantly to DNA methylation to silence TEs. We then showed that MAIN and its close homolog MAIN-LIKE 1 (MAIL1) interact together, but also with the phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPP) PP7-like (PP7L). Remarkably, mutants for MAIN, MAIL1 and PP7L display similar developmental phenotypes, and share common subsets of upregulated TEs and misregulated genes. Among the misregulated genes, we could identify discrete DNA motifs, suggesting that these genes are transcriptional regulated through similar mechanisms. Finally, phylogenetic analyses of PMD and PP7 domains among the angiosperm lineage suggest neo-association processes between the two protein domains to potentially generate new protein function. We propose that, through this interaction, the PMD and PP7 domains may constitute a functional protein module required for the proper expression of genes and silencing of TEs. Less...

PRJEB35832	Short-term effect of gene copy number variations in A. thalianaLow ribosomal RNA genes copy number provoke genomic instability and chromosomal segment duplication events that modify global gene expression and plant-pathogen response	Among the hundreds of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene copies organized as tandem repeats in the nucleolus organizer regions (NORs), only a portion is usually actively expressed in the nucleolus and participate in the ribosome biogenesis process. The role of these extra-copies remains elusive, but previous studies suggested their importance in genome stability and global gene expression. Because the nucleolus is also a platform for nuclear organization, we tested the impact of a decreased amount of rRNA gene copies on the Arabidopsis thaliana 3D genome organization and stability, using an A. thaliana line only containing 20% of rRNA gene copies (20rDNA line). Compared to the wild-type Col-0, the 20rDNA line shows several signs of genomic instability, such as variations in 3D genome organization, spontaneous double-strand breaks accumulation, transcriptomic changes, and higher DNA methylation level. Strikingly, using genomic and microscopic approaches, we identified seven large tandem duplications in direct orientation (TDDOs) ranging from 60 kb to 1.44 Mb. As a consequence, more than 600 genes were duplicated, often associated with an increase in their expression level. Among them, we found several upregulated genes involved in plant-pathogen response, which could explain why the 20rDNA line is hyper-resistant to both bacterial and nematode infections. Finally, we show that the TDDOs create gene fusions and/or truncations and we discuss their potential implications on plant genome evolution. Less...	
PRJEB36061	NADs identification under heat-stressNucleolus-associated chromatin domains are maintained under heat stress, despite nucleolar reorganization in Arabidopsis thaliana	Several layers of mechanisms participate in the plant adaptation to heat-stress. For example, the plant metabolism switches from cell growth mode to stress adaptation mode. the biogenesis of ribosomes is one of the most costly pathway in energy. This biogenesis process occurs in the nucleolus, the largest nuclear compartment, whose structure is highly dependent on this pathway. We used a nucleolar marker to track the structure of the nucleolus, and revealed a change in its sub-nucleolar distribution under heat stress. In addition, the nucleolus is implicated in other cellular processes, such as genome organization within the nucleus. However, our analyses of nucleolus-associated chromatin domains under heat stress did not revealed significant differences compare to the control plants, suggesting a lack of connection between two of the main function of the nucleolus: ribosome biogenesis and nuclear organisation.

PRJNA610417	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Transcriptomic analysis reveals Arabidopsis Auxin Resistant 1 gene as a key mediator for responses to bacteria.	The role of auxin in plant-microbe interaction has been primarily studied using indole-3-acetic acid (IAA)-producing pathogenic or plant growth promoting bacteria. However, the IAA biosynthesis pathway in bacteria involves indole related compounds and intermediates with lesser known functions. Here, we seek to understand changes in plant response to various bacteria strains that differ in their ability to produce indole related compounds. We previously isolated 47 bacterial strains from various duckweed ecotypes and determined 79% produced indole related compounds in culture, such as IAA, indole-lactic acid (ILA) and indole. Using Arabidopsis thaliana, we performed binary-association assays on a subset of these strains to evaluate physiological and transcriptomic responses in the plant. High quantity IAA-producing Microbacterium strains caused a short root phenotype on Arabidopsis, while a lower quantity IAA-producing Microbacterium strain affected auxin response genes in the absence of an obvious root phenotype. Use of the auxin insensitive mutants axr1-3 and tmk1 tmk3 TMK4/tmk4 revealed evidence for diverse functions of the AXR1 gene that may be related to bacterial interaction in addition to the IAA response. Moreover, our findings provided additional insights to the complex roles of IAA in plant-microbe interactions. Our results highlight the key role that AXR1 may play during the process of plant-bacteria interaction in general. Less...

PRJNA550121	Plant metabolism of nematode pheromones mediates plant-nematode interactions	Microorganisms and nematodes in the rhizosphere profoundly impact plant health, and small-molecule signaling is presumed to play a central role in plant rhizosphere interactions. However, the nature of the signals and underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here we show that the ascaroside ascr#18, a pheromone secreted by plant-parasitic nematodes, is employed by plants to generate chemical signals that repel nematodes and reduce infection. Comparative metabolomics of plant tissues and excretions revealed that ascr#18 is converted into shorter side-chained ascarosides that confer repellency. An Arabidopsis mutant defective in two peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidases does not metabolize ascr#18 and thus does not repel nematodes, indicating that plants, like nematodes, employ conserved peroxisomal β-oxidation to edit ascarosides and change their message. Our results reveal plant-editing of nematode pheromones as a defense mechanism that acts in parallel to conventional pattern-triggered immunity, demonstrating that plants may actively manipulate chemical signaling of associated microbiota.

Here we discovered MYB transcription factors MYB20, MYB42, MYB43 and MYB85 are transcriptional regulators directly activating lignin biosynthetic genes and phenylalanine biosynthetic genes during secondary wall formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Disruption of MYB20, MYB42, MYB43 and MYB85 resulted in growth development defects and significant reduction of lignin biosynthesis. In addition, our data showed that these MYB proteins directly activated the transcriptional repressors specifically inhibiting flavonoids biosynthesis that is competing with lignin biosynthesis for phenylalanine as precursors.

PRJNA371493	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Next Generation RNA Sequencing reveals defects in nuclear and chloroplast mRNA maturation of Arabidopsis thaliana lefko2 mutant	"Introduction: The Plant Organelle RNA Recognition (PORR) domain proteins are nucleus-encoded RNA-binding proteins that have acquired specific roles in organelle RNA metabolism as splicing factors of chloroplast group II introns. LEFKOTHEA (At5g62990) is a nuclear gene encoding a PORR domain protein that carries a transit peptide (TP) and monopartite or bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS). These motifs result in dual-targeting of LEFKOTHEA to the nucleus and chloroplasts implying a role in the splicing of chloroplast group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns. Therefore, we examined the splicing efficiency of plastid and nuclear genes in lefko2 mutant.
Methods: The lefko2 mutant is represented by the Salk T-DNA collection unicode SALK_044699/emb1692 and was obtained from the Nottingham Arabidopsis Stock Centre (NASC, Nottingham, UK). Embryo development in homozygous lefko2 plants is ceased abruptly arresting embryogenesis upon globular-to-heart stage transition. Total RNA was extracted using plant RNA kit spin columns with an on-column DNase treatment from heart-stage lefko2 mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis embryos. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA-seq libraries were generated using the TruSeq Low Input kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument at BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute). Raw reads were filtered into clean reads and aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10).  RNA-seq data were analyzed using the SOAPnuke (version v.1.5.2) with parameters “-l 15 -q 0.2 -n 0.05” and the HISAT2 pipeline (version 2.0.4) with parameters “--phred64 --sensitive --no-discordant --no-mixed -I 1 -X 1000”. Differential alternative splicing events were detected for lefko1 and wild-type using rMATS and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) tool.
Results: RNA-seq uncovered an outstanding number of coding or non-coding novel transcripts in lefko2 mutant embryos. Splicing defects were observed in numerous nuclear and plastid genes of lefko2 embryos compared to wild type. Among them, intron retention (IR) events were the most prominent. Further, the fidelity of 5’ splice site (5’SS) donor and 3’SS acceptor splicing was highly disturbed in lefko2 embryos. To less extend, exon skipping (ES) defects were also detected.
Conclusions: Detailed nuclear and chloroplast splicing events were widely observed in lefko2 aborted mutant embryos demonstrating a prevalent role of LEFKOTHEA in the splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA introns and chloroplast group II introns.

Methods: The lefko1 mutant was isolated from a genetic screen of an M2 EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col-0) background seed population. The lefko1 mutant allele has a white cotyledon phenotype caused by a G to A mutation in the coding region resulting in a Glycine (G) 373 to Aspartic acid (D) conversion.

PRJNA542090	Receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase CDG1 negatively regulates Arabidopsis pattern-triggered immunity and is co-opted by the Pseudomonas syringae effector AvrRpm1 (thale cress)	"In this study, we conducted protoplast-based gain-of-function assay to screen 23 members of the RLCK VII family for those whose overexpression can affect flg22-induced MAPK activation. We identified CDG1, a previously characterized positive regulator in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling (Kim et al., 2011), as a new negative regulator of flg22-triggered MAPK activation. We further found that CDG1 could constitutively associate with FLS2 and CERK1, and its transgenic overexpression could significantly reduce the abundances of these two essential PRRs, leading to impaired immune responses to both flg22 and chitin as well as increased susceptibility to bacterial and fungal pathogens. Surprisingly, the CDG1-mediated degradation of FLS2 and CERK1 is independent of E3 ubiquitin ligases PUB12/PUB13, but requires the kinase activity of MEKK1, a MAPKKK positively regulating plant innate immunity (Asai et al., 2002). Moreover, we demonstrated that RIN4 and the P. syringae effector AvrRpm1 could also interact with CDG1, and obtained evidence that CDG1 may be one of the RLCK VII members responsible for the AvrRpm1-induced RIN4 phosphorylation. Our data thus reveal multifaceted moonlight function of CDG1 in Arabidopsis innate immunity in addition to its originally characterized role in BR signaling.
Overall design: We noted that the growth defects of CDG1 OE plants were largely suppressed in the mekk1/pMEKK1::MEKK1K361M-FLAG/CDG1 OE (hereafter referred to as MEKK1K361M/CDG1 OE) plants.

PRJNA542085	Hypoxic gene expression in med25-1 (thale cress)	"Plants as obligate aerobic organisms are severely affected by flooding-induced oxygen restriction. As a consequence, they suffer from energy deficits which are counterbalanced by activation of anaerobic metabolism genes through subgroup VII ETHYLENE-RESPONSE FACTOR (ERFVII) transcription factors. Despite the crucial role of ERFVIIs in regulating transcript responses to hypoxia in multiple plant species, it is not understood how these factors mechanistically initiate hypoxic gene expression. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis ERFVIIs RELATED TO APETALA 2.12 (RAP2.12) and RAP2.2 recruit the Mediator complex, present in all higher eukaryotes, in order to convey stress signals to RNA polymerase II. This is achieved by specific interaction with Mediator subunit 25 (AtMED25). Both RAP2.12 and RAP2.2 require AtMED25 for full activity and subsequent induction of target hypoxia core genes. Our findings support an interplay of multiple coactivators under hypoxia and underline the flexible nature of the Mediator complex composition, which both help to meet specific cellular demands under (hypoxic) stress conditions.

Following a chemical genetics approach, we screened a chemical library for compounds that restored abolished hypocotyl elongation in the pif4-2 deficient mutant background in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana.

PRJNA543995	Enzymes degraded under high light maintain proteostasis by transcriptional regulation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Photo-inhibitory high-light stress induces damage to photosystems and changes a myriad of metabolic processes in plants. In Arabidopsis it leads to increased abundance of markers of protein degradation and transcriptional upregulation of proteases and proteolytic machinery, but proteostasis is largely maintained. To identify specific enzymes degrading at a faster rate under high light conditions, we developed a 13C partial labelling approach to measure rates of turnover of specific proteins in Arabidopsis rosettes. We identified 73 proteins with rates of protein degradation enhanced by high-light. In addition to the expected increase in degradation rate of the photosystem II (PSII) D1 subunit, we discovered significant increases in degradation rate for specific molecular chaperones, nitrate reductase, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and phosphoglycerate kinase. Significant increases in degradation of 65 other plastid, mitochondrial, peroxisomal, and cytosolic enzymes were also found, including factors involved in redox shuttles within and between organelles and the cytosol. Coupled analysis of protein degradation rate, transcriptional rate, and protein abundance revealed that 57% of the nuclear-encoded enzymes with higher degradation rates also had high light-induced transcriptional responses, ensuring proteostasis. In contrast, plastid-encoded proteins with enhanced turnover rates showed decreased transcript abundances and must maintain protein abundance by other processes. This analysis reveals a light-induced transcriptional program for nuclear-encoded genes, beyond the regulation of PSII D1 subunit and the function of PSII, to replace key protein degradation targets in plants and ensure proteostasis under high-light stress.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia-0 plants were grown under 16/8-h light/dark conditions with cool white T8 tubular fluorescent lamps 4000K 3350 lm (Osram, Germany) with intensity of 100–125 μmol m-2 s-1 at 22 °C. Arabidopsis plants were grown in soil pots for 21 days until they reached leaf production stage 1.10 (Boyes et al., 2001). Shoots of Arabidopsis at the leaf production stage 1.10 were positioned into the sealed growth chamber with the soil pots kept underneath. Six tandem growth chambers were supplied with air at a continuous flow rate 6 L/min and kept overnight before the labelling experiment (T0). A homemade water column was connected to the air hose to keep the air humidity inside the growth chamber. A commercial LED (Heliospectra) were used as the light source for the labelling experiment and the light spectra was set as (420nm-250, 450nm-638, 530nm-750, 630nm-1000, 660nm-250 and 735nm-25). Normal and high light intensity at 100 and 500 µE was achieved by adjusting the distance between the growth chamber and the light source.
Shoot tissues were harvested in biological triplicate after differing light transitions from dark: T0D - end of night (dark control), T2H - 2 hours high light, T2L - 2 hours standard light, T5H - 5 hours high light, T5L - 5 hours standard light, T8H - 8 hours high light, and T8L - 8 hours standard light.

PRJNA544185	The Arabidopsis YDL1 suppresses singlet oxygen-induced gene expression changes (thale cress)	"Singlet oxygen (1O2), the main ROS produced in chloroplasts, has long been recognized as a cytotoxin that inhibits photosynthesis and damages the cell. However, more recent findings have proposed 1O2 as a highly versatile signal that induces various stress responses. A signaling role for 1O2 was first documented in the conditional fluorescent (flu) mutant of Arabidopsis. Release of 1O2 in flu mutant induces bleach/die of young seedlings and growth inhibition of mature plants. However, all these drastic phenotypic changes can be suppressed by mutation of EXCUTER1 (EX1) gene. The Arabidopsis YDL1 was identified during a screen of revertant mutant from EMS mutagenized flu/ex1. Loss of function of SAFE1 leads to highly expression of 1O2-indluced genes in flu/ex1 mutant, mimicking the flu mutant. We found that YDL1 localized in the stroma of chloroplast, and suppressed 1O2-mediated stress responses via inhibiting 1O2-induced damage on the grana margins.

PRJNA544417	In Arabidopsis hybrids and Hybrid Mimics up-regulation of cell wall biogenesis is associated with increased plant size (thale cress)	"Hybrid breeding is of economic importance in agriculture for increasing yield, yet the basis of the heterosis is not well understood. In Arabidopsis, crosses between different accessions produce hybrids with varied levels of heterosis relative to parental phenotypes in biomass. In all hybrids the advantages of the F1 hybrid is lost in the F2 for both phenotypic uniformity and yield gain. Success in generating F5/F6 Hybrid Mimic from the cross between C24 and Landsberg erecta (Ler) demonstrated that the large plant phenotype of the F1 hybrids can be stabilized. Hybrid Mimics selection was applied to Wassilewskija (Ws)/Ler and Col/Ler hybrids. The two hybrids showing different levels of heterosis. At 30 DAS, the Col/Ler hybrid generated Hybrid Mimics with rosette diameter and fresh weight equivalent to the F1 hybrid; Ws/Ler Hybrid Mimics outperformed the F1 hybrids in both the rosette size and biomass. Transcriptome analysis revealed up-regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and expansion genes could be a common pathway in increased size in Arabidopsis hybrids and Hybrid Mimics. Intercross of two independent Hybrid Mimic lines can further increase the biomass gain. Our results encourage the use of Hybrid Mimics for breeding and for investigating the molecular basis of heterosis.
Overall design: Arabidopsis hybrid seeds [Wassilewskija (Ws)/Landsberg erecta (Ler), Col/Ler and C24/Ler] were produced by hand-pollination between parental accessions. Ws/Ler and Col/Ler Hybrid Mimic lines and F7 small plant lines were produced from the recurrent selection protocol (Wang et al., 2015, Wang et al., 2017). Sterilized seeds were sown onto plates with Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium (Murashige and Skoog Basal Salts with minimal organics, Sigma-Aldrich, M6899) supplemented with 3% (wt/vol) sucrose and 0.8% wt/vol agar, pH5.7. Seeds were kept at 4 °C in the dark, then transferred into a growth room with conditions of 16h light (22°C)/8h dark (18°C) and light density at 120 -150 μmol photons m-2·s-1. Plate-grown seedlings were transferred into soil at 15 days after sowing. For the sample set of Ws/Ler system, the rosette leaves of 25 day-old parents Ws and Ler, two reciprocal hybrids Ws x Ler and Ler x Ws, seven Hybrid Mimic lines (WL_HM1-7) and two small lines (wl_sml1-2) were collected at time Zeitgeber Time (ZT)  = 6-8 (ZT = 0 refers to dawn). For the same set of Col/Ler system, the rosette leaves of 25 day-old parents Col, two reciprocal hybrids Col x Ler and Ler x Col, six Hybrid Mimic lines (CL_HM1-6) and two small lines (cl_sml1-2) were collected. The transcriptomes of Hybrid Mimics CL_HM5 and CL_HM6 were excluded from the analysis due to unsatisfactory phenotypes of plant size at sampling day -25 DAS. For the parents and hybrids, three biological replicates were collected per plant line; rosette leaves from three plants of each genotype were pooled as one biological replicate. For each Hybrid Mimic and small line, rosette leaves of three siblings were collected separately as three biological replicates. Less..."

PRJNA544694	Removal of H2Aub1 by ubiquitin-specific proteases 12 and 13 is required for stable Polycomb-mediated gene repression in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Background: Stable gene repression is essential for normal growth and development. Polycomb Repressive Complexes 1 and 2 (PRC1 & PRC2) are involved in this process by establishing monoubiquitinated histone 2A (H2Aub1) and subsequent trimethylation of lysine 27 of histone 3 (H3K27me3). Previous work proposed that H2Aub1 removal by the ubiquitin-specific proteases 12 and 13 (UBP12 & UBP13) is part of the repressive PRC1&2 system, but its functional role remains elusive.
Results: We show that UBP12 and UBP13 work together with PRC1, PRC2, and EMF1 to repress genes involved in stimulus response. We found that H2Aub1 is associated with responsiveness, and that it’s only indirectly repressive via PRC2 recruitment. Our analyses also revealed that PR2 targets that do not require PRC1 are pre-repressed. Lastly, we have found that removal of H2Aub1 by UBP12/13 prevents loss of H3K27me3, consistent with our finding that the H3K27me3 demethylase REF6 is enriched at H2Aub1 marked genes.
Conclusions: Our data allow us to propose a model in which deposition of H2Aub1 permits recruitment of PRC2 and provides a state that allows for a rapid switch between gene activation and repression. Removal of H2Aub1 by UBP12/13 is required to achieve stable repression.
Overall design: RNAseq of single and double mutants for the UBP12/13 genes, plus wild-type control, three biological replicates of each genotype. Three ChIP-seq experiments on the double mutant and wild-type; the first including H2Aub1, H2A.Z, H3, and input. The second including H3K27me3, and H3. The third including REF6 (GFP), and input.

PRJNA545224	SIN3 LIKE genes mediate long-day induction of flowering but inhibit the floral transition in short days through histone deacetylation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"We show that in Arabidopsis SIN3 LIKE (SNL)family genes encoding a scoffold protein for assembly of histone deacetylase complex, directly regulate the expression of an FT activator and three FT repressors to regulate the transition to flowering in short days and long days, respectively. Under inductive long days, SNLs including SIN3 LIKE 1(SNL1) to SNL5, function in partial redundancy to repress the expression of three AP2 family transcription factors that repress FT expression, and thus mediate long-day induction of FT expression and promote the transitiion to flowering. In contrast, under non-inductive short days SNLs act to inhibit the floral transition, partly through direct repression of a MADS box transcriptional factor that promotes FT expression. Thus, our results reveal that SNLs, through histone deacetylation, play a novel dual role for the control of flowering in the long-day plant Arabidopsis: inhibiting flowering when the day length is shorter and promoting the floral transition when days become longer than a threshold length.
Overall design: Total RNAs were extracted from the aerial parts of 11-day-old seedlings of LDs grown wild type(WT) and snl1/2/3/4/5 quintuple mutant (snl1-5) (harvested at ZT5) by Rneasy Plus mini kit (Qiagen).

Although miRNAs are required throughout plant development, relatively little is known regarding their embryonic functions. To systematically characterize embryonic miRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana, we developed or applied high-throughput sequencing based methods to profile hundreds of miRNAs and associated targets throughout embryogenesis. We discovered dozens of miRNAs that dynamically cleave and repress target transcripts including 30 that encode transcription factors. Transcriptome analyses indicated that these miRNA:target interactions have a profound impact on embryonic gene expression programs, and we further demonstrated that the miRNA-mediated repression of six transcription factors were individually required for embryo morphogenesis. These data indicate that the miRNA-directed repression of multiple transcription factors is critically important for the establishment of the plant body plan, and provide a foundation to further investigate how miRNAs contribute to these initial cellular differentiation events.

This view is supported by our earlier data showing that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes altered due to the silencing of the nuclear RPS10 gene encoding mitochondrial ribosomal protein S10 differentially translate mitochondrial transcripts compared with the wild-type. Here, we used ribosome profiling to determine the contribution of transcriptional and translational control in the regulation of protein synthesis in rps10 mitochondria compared with the wild-type ones. Oxidative phosphorylation system proteins are preferentially synthesized in wild-type mitochondria but this feature is lost in the mutant. The rps10 mitoribosomes show slightly reduced translation efficiency of most respiration-related proteins and at the same time markedly more efficiently synthesize ribosomal proteins and MatR and TatC proteins. The mitoribosomes deficient in S10 protein protect shorter transcript fragments which exhibit a weaker 3-nucleotide periodicity compared with the wild-type. The decrease in the triplet periodicity is particularly drastic for genes containing introns. Notably, splicing is considerably less effective in the mutant, indicating an unexpected link between the deficiency of S10 and mitochondrial splicing. Thus, a shortage of the mitoribosomal S10 protein has wide-ranging consequences on mitochondrial gene expression.

PRJNA548351	AtDXO1 possesses deNADding and exonuclease activities and plays pleiotropic roles in gene regulation (thale cress)	"RNA capping and decapping tightly coordinate with transcription, translation, and RNA decay to regulate gene expression. The DXO/Rai1 family of proteins have been implicated in mRNA decapping and decay, and mammalian DXO was recently found to also function as a decapping enzyme for NAD+-capped RNAs (NAD-RNA). The Arabidopsis genome contains a single gene encoding a DXO/Rai1 protein, AtDXO1. Here we show that AtDXO1 possesses both NAD-RNA decapping activity and 5’-3’ exonuclease activity and that the atdxo1 mutation increases the stability of NAD-RNAs. The atdxo1 mutant displays severe growth retardation, pale color, and multiple developmental defects. Transcriptome profiling analysis showed that the atdxo1 mutation leads to elevated expression of defense-related genes and down-regulation of photosynthesis genes. The autoimmunity phenotype of the mutant could be suppressed by either eds1 or npr1 mutation. Surprisingly, the various phenotypes associated with the atdxo1 mutant could be complemented by the enzymatically inactive AtDXO1. We found that AtDXO1 interacts with RNA cap methyltransferase (CMT). The atdxo1 mutation apparently enhances post-transcriptional gene silencing by elevating levels of siRNAs. Our study indicates that AtDXO1 regulates gene expression in various biological and physiological processes through its pleiotropic molecular functions in mediating RNA processing and decay.

PRJNA548877	Glycosyltransferase-like RSE1 negatively regulates leaf senescence by modulating salicylic acid signaling in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Leaf senescence is a developmental process designed for nutrient recycling and relocation to maximize growth competence and reproductive capacity of plants.  Thus, plants integrate developmental and environmental signals to precisely control senescence.  However, it remains largely elusive as to how plants coordinate genetic, epigenetic, and metabolic pathways for the regulation of senescence.  To genetically dissect the complex regulatory mechanism underlying leaf senescence, we identified an early leaf senescence mutant, rse1.  RSE1 encodes a putative glycosyltranferase.  Loss-of-function mutations in RSE1 resulted in precocious leaf yellowing and up-regulation of senescence maker genes, indicating enhanced leaf senescence.  Transcriptome analysis revealed that salicylic acid (SA) and defense signaling cascades were activated in rse1 prior to the onset of leaf senescence.  In agreement with the phenotypes, we found that SA accumulation was significantly increased in rse1.  We also discovered that the rse1 phenotypes are dependent on SA-INDUCTION DEFICIENT 2 (SID2), indicating a role of SA in accelerated leaf senescence in rse1.  Furthermore, RSE1 protein was localized to the cell walls, and rse1 displayed increased glucose contents in the cell walls, implying a possible link between the cell walls and RSE1 function. Together, we show that RSE1 negatively modulate leaf senescence through an SID2-dependent SA signaling pathway.

PRJNA549259	Generation of a fertile ask1 mutant uncovers a comprehensive set of SCF‐mediated intracellular functions (thale cress)	"Purpose: Ubiquitin-mediated proteolysis by the 26S proteasome is a critical regulatory mechanism controlling many biological processes.  The multi-subunit Skp1-Cullin1-F-box (SCF) complexes are designed to select substrates for ubiquitylation in all eukaryotes.  Within these complexes, the Skp1 protein is defined as the bridge between the F-box and the Cullin1 proteins.  In Arabidopsis thaliana, there are 19 Arabidopsis Skp1-Like (ASK) genes that encode Skp1 proteins.  Our previous genomics and evolutionary studies suggest that ASK1 plays a predominant role in the ASK family.  To demonstrate this hypothesis, we genetically introduced the same Ds insertion allele of ask1-1 in Ler into the Arabidopsis Col-0 reference genome.  The ask1-1 allele was initially obtained from an ask1-1(+/-)ask2-1(+/-)/LerWs double heterozygous mutant (Liu et al., 2004).  To identify the breadth and depth of SCF functions, we applied RNA-Seq sequencing to systematically analyze the perturbation of transcriptomes in both floral bud and open flower tissues in this novel ask1 mutant.
Method: Two replicates of total RNA were extracted from 10-50 mg of floral buds or open flowers from Col-0, ask1, and ASK1 (WT allele) primary inflorescences five hours after dawn grown under a long-day photoperiod condition. The NucleoSpin® RNA kit (Macherey-Nagel) was used for RNA extraction following the manufacturer’s instructions.  1 μg each from the 12 RNA samples was used for pair end 150-mer deep sequencing using a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Novogene).  Adapter and low-quality sequences in the raw FASTQ sequencing data were removed to produce valid sequences using Trimmomatic (phred=33, minimum length=36; (Bolger et al., 2014)), which were further aligned to the A. thaliana Col-0 reference genome (TAIR10; http://www.arabidopsis.org) via TOPHAT2 (Kim et al., 2013a) to identify accepted hits of each locus.  HTSeq was then used to calculate an absolute expression level (counts) of each locus based on the accepted hits (Anders et al., 2015).  The resulting counts per locus were normalized to counts per million reads (CPM) among all 12 libraries and used to identify groups of SDEGs in bud and open flower tissues in ask1 and ASK1 through comparing to the WT bud and open flower tissues, respectively, by edgeR (Log2FC ≥ 1; FDR < 0.01%; (Robinson et al., 2010)).
Results: In total, 52 and 54 SDEGs were identified to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in ASK1 BC10F4 bud tissues; and 13 and 3 SDEGs were identified to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively, in ASK1 BC10F4 open flower tissues (2-fold change (FC) with a false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01).  However, 306 and 941 SDEGs (in total 1,247) in ask1 bud tissues and 392 and 1,137 SDEGs (in total 1,529) in ask1 open flower tissues were identified to be up-regulated and down-regulated, respectively (2-FC and FDR < 0.01).
Conclusions: Compared to Col-0, 527 and 640 SDEGs were identified in Ler and Ws, respectively, which were greatly higher than the number of SDEGs identified in ASK1 floral bud (Fisher’s exact test, p = 6.0e-82 and 7.5e-112, respectively) and open flower tissues (Fisher’s exact test, p = 7.4e-150 and 1.2e-186, respectively).  Therefore, we concluded that the genetic background of ASK1 and ask1 are isogenic to Col-0.  The large array of SDEGs identified in both floral buds and open flower tissues in ask1 demonstrated a wide range of roles of ASK1-containing SCF complexes.
Overall design: Two replicates of total RNA were extracted from 10-50 mg of floral buds or open flowers from Col-0, ask1, and ASK1 (WT allele) primary inflorescences five hours after dawn grown under a long-day photoperiod condition. Transcriptome profiles were generated in duplicates by pair end 150-mer deep sequencing using a NovaSeq 6000 platform (Novogene)."	
PRJNA549285	Chimeric activators and repressors define HY5 activity and a feedback control mechanism in Arabidopsis (HY5_RNAseq) (thale cress)	"Transcription regulation requires many protein interactions on chromatin, and only a subset of transcription factors have well-defined activation or repression domains. The Arabidopsis transcription factor HY5 controls critical growth-related gene expression programs during plant development, but it’s primary activity in regulating transcription remains unclear. To address this question, we generated constitutive repressor and  activator HY5 fusion proteins to direct the expression of HY5 target genes. We used RNA-seq, ChIP-seq, and multiple phenotypes to demonstrate that HY5 depends on accessory factors to promote transcription and identify high confidence direct targets of HY5. We suggest that this strategy can be used broadly to define the transcription regulation activity and direct targets of transcription factors. Interestingly, this approach also revealed a mechanism by which HY5 promotes the accumulation of its own negative regulators. We show that HY5 directly regulates components of the COP1 E3-ubiquitin ligase complex, and  by uncoupling this feedback loop we can induce partial de-etiolation in the dark. This provides a system by which plants can quickly repress growth upon light exposure. Lastly, we show that modulating this system can generate significant phenotypic diversity and provide proof of concept that these fusion proteins can modulate growth in tomato,  opening a novel path toward selecting desirable traits in crop species.

PRJNA549286	Tissue specific light response during Arabidopsis de-etiolation (thale cress)	"The time between seed germination and the development of the first true leaves is crucial for plants success.  Depending on the environmental light conditions a plant must decide which developmental program to use. If light is limited, the seedling will use etiolated growth characterized by an elongated hypocotyl and tightly-closed, underdeveloped cotyledons, thus allowing it to reach a light source as quickly as possible. In contrast, seedlings that are grown in unlimited light will use de-etiolation growth, that is characterized by inhibited hypocotyl growth and unhooked, unfolded and fully expanded cotyledons. These seedlings become photosynthetic and increase their chances for reproduction. Interestingly, the outcome of the light signal varies between the seedling’s different organs, e.g. hypocotyl growth is inhibited by light whereas cotyledon expansion is induced. Separating the cotyledons and hypocotyls of de-etiolated seedlings during their first 12 hours of white light exposure, enabled us to perform individual transcriptome analyses of each organ and to examine what causes this variation in light responsiveness.

PRJNA506408	Integrative analysis from the epigenome to translatome uncovers patterns of dominant nuclear regulation during transient stress (thale cress)	"Background: The regulation of gene activity in response to energy availability is an universal phenomenon. When molecular oxygen is limited the production of ATP is inefficient and growth is curtailed. The plant Arabidopsis thaliana rapidly responds to oxygen deprivation (hypoxia) by elevating the abundance of ~50 hypoxia-responsive gene (HRG) transcripts that are prioritized for translation. Many other cellular mRNAs are sequestered in ribonucleoprotein complexes and not translated during hypoxia, including those encoding ribosomal proteins (RPs). Little is known of the effect of hypoxia on nuclear regulatory processes including histone modifications, chromatin accessibility, RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) engagement and nascent transcript production. Here we apply genomic technologies to evaluate epigenetic and transcriptional regulation in response to hypoxia.
Results: Hypoxia-induced dynamics in eight chromatin readouts were contrasted to the nuclear, polyadenylated and ribosome-associated mRNAs of Arabidopsis seedlings. This identified patterns of regulatory variation of gene cohorts including the HRGs and RPs. HRGs were characterized by increased chromatin accessibility in their promoters, as well as eviction of the Histone 2A.Z variant, elevation of Histone 3-lysine 9 acetylation, and engagement of RNAPII-Ser2P active in elongation. Following short term stress, over half of the HRGs promoters were bound by the Ethylene Responsive Factor group VII transcription factor, HYPOXIA-RESPONSIVE ERF 2 (HRE2), encoded by an HRG.  Prolonged stress maintained  RP transcription, accompanied by elevated Histone 3-lysine 14 acetylation (H3K14ac) and nuclear RNA retention. The stress-induced activation of genes associated with heat stress was distinct from the HRGs. These had high RNAPII-Ser2P engagement and nuclear accumulation after short term hypoxia without accumulation of higher levels of polyA RNA. These more progressively upregulated genes were enriched for cis-elements recognized by HEAT SHOCK FACTOR transcriptional activators and had more 5' biased histone marks on their gene bodies They had less H2A.Z eviction, Histone 3-lysine 4 trimethylation and H3K9ac than genes with promoters bound by HRE2 and coordinately upregulated from RNAPII-Ser2P engagement to translation. Genes associated with the circadian cycle, photosynthesis and development were also temporally regulated by hypoxia.
Conclusions: Hypoxic stress triggers dynamic epigenetic and transcriptional regulatory variations that differentiate rapid versus more progressive activation of stress-gene transcripts that are destined for translation. Growth-associated genes continue to be transcribed but their nascent transcripts are retained in the nucleus.
Overall design: Examination of four histone modifications, one histone variant, chromatin accessibility, RNAP Ser2P association, nuclear RNA, poly(A)+ RNA, and TRAP-RNA in control and hypoxia stressed Arabidopsis seelings.  RNA-seq based data was performed in triplicate.  ChIP-seq and ATAC-seq data were performed in duplicate.

There are two major types of plant pattern recognition receptors: 1. Leucine-rich repeat receptor proteins (LRR-RP) and LRR receptor kinases (LRR-RK) and 2. Plant receptor proteins and receptor kinases carrying ectopic lysin motifs (LysM-RP and LysM-RK). In this study, Arabidopsis thaliana responses to three different MAMPs, flg22, nlp20, chitin (C6), via their corresponding receptor types, FLS2 (LRR-RK), RLP23 (LRR-RP), CERK1 (LysM-RK) were compared. Our RNA-seq results indicate that a core set of defense-related genes can be activated through perception of different MAMPs. However, there are also notable differences in the transcriptional changes in response to the various elicitors; flg22 causes broader transcriptome changes than nlp20 and C6, and C6 does not cause late transcriptome changes.

Artificial SV also served as a novel trigger of induced resistance, although approaches for activating such plant innate immunity intensively studied on the use of biological and chemical agents (BCA). Artificial SV pre-treatment protected Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings against insect pests and fungal pathogens. However, SV-mediated epigenetic modulation remains unexplored while CBA-mediated induced resistance is known as a complicated process involving epigenetic regulation. Here, we performed a gene expression profiling basd on RNA-seq experiment to understand the role of 10 kHz SV-mediated epigenetic modification in induced resistance against a soil-borne pathogenic bacterium Ralstonia solanacearum.
Overall design: A group of plants was prepared to be expose to sound vibration (SV, 10 kHz) at 90 dB every 3 h for 10 days. Another group of plants dreched with benzothiadiazole (BTH) were also prepared as a positive control group. The other group of plants with non-treatment were also prepared as a control group. Then, all samples were drenched with a pathogen (R. solanacearum). Transcriptome data were generated by performing RNA-seq analysis of 29 arabidopsis samples, which were obtained at 0d, 1d and 2d after dreching pathogen.

PRJNA551455	FIERY1 promotes microRNA accumulation by suppressing rRNA-derived small interfering RNAs in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Plant  microRNAs (miRNAs) associate with ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) to direct post-transcriptional gene silencing and regulate numerous biological processes. Although AGO1 predominantly binds miRNAs in vivo, AGO1 also associates with endogenous small interfering RNAs (siRNAs). It is unclear whether the miRNA/siRNA balance affects miRNA activities. Here we report that FIERY1 (FRY1), which is involved in 5’-3’ RNA degradation, regulates miRNA abundance and function by suppressing the biogenesis of ribosomal RNA-derived siRNAs (risiRNAs). In mutants of FRY1 and the nuclear 5’-3’ exonuclease genes XRN2 and XRN3, we found that a large number of 21-nt risiRNAs were generated through an endogenous siRNA biogenesis pathway. The production of risiRNAs correlated with pre-rRNA processing defects in these mutants. We also show that these risiRNAs were loaded into AGO1, causing reduced loading of miRNAs.

PRJNA551939	The epidermis coordinates thermoresponsive growth through the phyB-PIF4-auxin pathway (thale cress)	"In plants, an elevation in ambient temperature induces morphological changes including elongation hypocotyls, considered to be adaptive responses to alleviate the heat-induced damages. The high temperature-induced morphological changes are called thermomorphogenesis, which is predominantly regulated by a bHLH transcription factor PIF4. Although PIF4 is expressed in all aerial tissues including the epidermis, mesophyll, and vascular bundle, its tissue-specific functions in thermomorphogenesis are not known. Here, we found that epidermis-specific expression of PIF4 induced constitutive long hypocotyls, while vasculature-specific expression of PIF4 had no effect on hypocotyl growth. Consistently, RNA-Seq and qRT-PCR analyses revealed that auxin responsive genes and growth-related genes were highly activated by epidermal, but not by vascular, PIF4. The epidermal, but not vascular, inactivation of PIF4 by a PIF4 artificial microRNA or a dominant negative form of PIF4 suppressed thermoresponsive gene expression and hypocotyl growth. Additionally, both the block of epidermal auxin signaling and the epidermal overexpression of a thermosensor phytochrome B (phyB) inhibited thermoresponsive growth, indicating that epidermal PIF4-auxin pathway are essential for the temperature responses. We further show that epidermal PIF4 is increased by high temperatures mainly through the transcriptional activation of PIF4. Taken together, our study demonstrates that the epidermis regulates thermoresponsive growth through the phyB-PIF4-auxin pathway.

PRJNA552958	Redox-sensitive bZIP68 plays a role in balancing stress tolerance with growth in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Perturbation of the cellular redox state by stress conditions is sensed by redox-sensitive proteins so that the cell can physiologically respond to stressors; however, the mechanisms linking sensing to response remain poorly understood in plants. Here we report that the transcription factor bZIP68 underwent in vivo oxidation in Arabidopsis cells under oxidative stress which is dependent on its redox-sensitive Cys320 residue. bZIP68 is primarily localized to the nucleus under normal conditions in Arabidopsis seedlings and oxidative stress reduces its accumulation in the nucleus and increases its cytosolic localization. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) revealed that bZIP68 primarily binds to promoter regions containing the core G-box (CACGTG) or G-box-like motif of the genes involved in abiotic and biotic stress responses, photosynthesis, biosynthetic processes, and transcriptional regulation. The bzip68 mutant displayed slower growth but enhanced tolerance to oxidative stress. The results from the ChIP-seq and phenotypic and transcriptome comparison between the bzip68 mutant and wildtype indicate that bZIP68 normally suppresses expression of stress tolerance genes and promotes expression of growth-related genes, whereas its inactivation enhances stress tolerance but suppresses growth. bZIP68 might balance stress tolerance with growth through the extent of its oxidative inactivation according to the environment.

PRJNA553702	Comparative transcriptome analysis of melatonin or auxin treated-Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Objective: Melatonin and auxin are both tryptophan-derived indole molecules. Much attention has been given to proposed auxin-like activities of melatonin (regulating growth concentration-dependently). However, it still largely remains unclear whether melatonin and auxin regulate signalling pathways in a similar fashion. The purpose of this study is to directly compare the transcriptome response of Arabidopsis with melatonin or auxin.
Method: mRNA profiles of 12-day old rosettes treated for a further of 3 days with +/- melatonin (5µM, 1005µM) or NAA(4.5µM) were generated by RNA-sequencing in triplicates (three independent biological experiments), using Illumina NextSeq 550 technology.
Results: Comparative global transcriptome analysis conducted on Arabidopsis rosette treated with melatonin or NAA under exact same set of experimental conditions revealed differential number of genes and type of pathways. While auxin (4.5µM) regulated a large number of genes and elicited a diverse response, melatonin (100µM) showed a modest effect on transcriptome with only few genes significantly regulated whereas none regulated at approximately equimolar concentration with NAA (5µM) as compared to untreated solvent control (0.1% EtOH). Interestingly, the most prominent category of genes regulated by melatonin trended towards biotic stress defense pathways.
Conclusions: These findings indicate that melatonin and auxin act quite differently toward signaling pathways in Arabidopsis. Melatonin has its own set of mechanisms to exert its functions, with strong inclination toward biotic defense pathways.

Understanding the regulation of this process is essential for reducing our dependence on nitrogen fertilizers and increasing agricultural sustainability. Our lab is interested in chromatin changes that accompany the transition to leaf senescence. Previously, darker green leaves were reported for Arabidopsis thaliana hac1 mutants, defective in a gene encoding a histone acetyltransferase in the CREB-binding protein family. Here, we show that two Arabidopsis hac1 alleles display delayed age-related developmental senescence, but have normal dark-induced senescence. Using a combination of ChIP-seq for H3K9ac and RNA-seq for gene expression, we identified 44 potential HAC1 targets during age-related developmental senescence. Genetic analysis demonstrated that one of these potential targets, ERF022, is a positive regulator of leaf senescence. ERF022 is regulated additively by HAC1 and MED25, suggesting MED25 may recruit HAC1 to the ERF022 promoter to increase its expression in older leaves.

RNA-seq was used to identify gene expression changes occuring at the time of bolting, independent of leaf age.
Overall design: Two homozygous atx1/atx3/atx4 triple T-DNA insertion mutants were isolated (TM1 and TM2). Both have the same T-DNA mutant alleles but come from different crosses so they may contain different background mutations. atx triple mutants display significant early flowering and significant early leaf senescence phenotypes. Previous phenotype analyses show that early leaf senescence was detected at day 33 in the triple mutants. RNA-seq was used to identify gene expression changes occurring at the time of bolting that might be promoting the onset of leaf senescence, thus coupling the early flowering phenotype to the early leaf senescence phenotype (see ""Timeseries Design Infographic""). Triple Mutants bolting at the peak of triple mutant bolting (Days 24 and 25, see ""Peak of Triple Mutant Bolting Info"" for details) were pooled and then 1/4th of these bolting plants were harvested. Plants were then randomly selected for harvesting from this pool in two day increments, three times. Thus, harvesting days were 25, 27, 29, and 31 days after stratification. This strategy was used to ensure the TM plants harvested at each time point were developmentally similar. The sixth leaf to emerge was harvested from each plant.

PRJNA554582	Transcriptome and binding data indicate that citral inhibits single strand DNA-binding proteins (thale cress)	"BCKGROUND: Citral is a phytochemical monoterpene aldehyde that has been reported to be phytotoxic to a number of plant species. When treated in a solution, citral was phytotoxic to barnyard grass, wild oat, redroot pigweed, ribwort, lettuce, and barley, but not active on soybean, rice, maize, wheat, field bindweed, or common purslane. To investigate the mechanism of citral phytotoxicity in plant, we performed transcriptome analysis experiments using the model plant Arabidopsis.
RESULTS: The concentration of citral that inhibited growth by 50% (202 μM) down regulated transcription of 9156 and 5541 genes in roots and shoots, respectively, at the p ≤ 0.001 level after 1 h.  Only 56 and 62 genes in roots and shoots, respectively, were upregulated. In the roots, these effects dissipated after 3 and 6 h, but similar effects began again at 12 and continued until 24 h.  In the shoots, the down regulation increased at 3 h (6239 genes downregulated, vs. 66 upregulated) with the effect decreasing at from 6 to 24 h, with only 1 gene downregulated at 24 h. Of all genes affected in roots at 1 h and shoots at 3 h (times of greatest effect), 6.5 and 9.2 %, respectively, of affected genes were for DNA and RNA binding functions.  Genes for single strand DNA binding proteins (SSBP) WHY1, WHY 2 and WHY3 were strongly downregulated in the shoot up until 12 h after citral exposure.
CONCLUSIONS: Molecular docking analysis suggests a potential binding model of citral with the single-strand binding proteins (SSBPs) WHY1, WHY2, and WHY3, as well as with other transcription factors such as MYC-2, ANAC, and SCR-SHR.  Such an effect could account for the profound and unusual effects on down-regulation of gene transcription.
Overall design: Arabidopsis seedlings (14 days-old) were treated with citral at IC50 concentration (202 µM). After treatment, plants were incubated for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h. Three replicate samples were collected from control plants (0.1% EtOH) and treated plants for each time point. Less..."

PRJNA554610	Lipophilic-Signals Lead to Organ-Specific Gene Expression Changes in Arabidopsis Seedlings (thale cress)	"Purpose: Using RNA-seq and differential expression analysis, we examined the NAE-type and organ-specific  genetic pathways involved in transducing ear;y signals into downstream physiological changes involved in Arabidopsis seedling growth.
Methods: Intact seedlings and dissected cotyledon and root mRNA profiles of  3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings treated with DMSO, 40 µM NAE 18:2 or 80 µM NAE 18:3  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using the Illumina Next-Seq 500 system. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed using STAR followed by DESeq2. qRT–PCR validation was performed using  SYBR Green assays
Results: Using RNA-seq and differential expression analysis, we identified early (1 h) transcriptional changes induced by the exogenous treatment of NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 in cotyledons, roots and intact seedlings. These two treatments led to a significant enrichment in ABA-response and chitin-response genes in organs where the treatments led to changes in development. In Arabidopsis seedlings, NAE 18:2 treatment led to the repression of genes involved in cell wall biogenesis and organization in roots and seedlings. In addition, cotyledons, roots, and seedlings treated with NAE 18:3 also showed a decrease in transcripts that encode proteins involved in growth processes. NAE 18:3 also led to changes in the abundance of transcripts involved in the modulation of chlorophyll biosynthesis and catabolism in cotyledons. Overall, NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 treatment led to lipid-type and organ-specific gene expression changes that include overlapping and non-overlapping gene sets. These data will provide future, rich opportunities to examine the genetic pathways involved in transducing early signals into downstream physiological changes in seedling growth.
Conclusions: A detailed transcriptional analyses provided insight into the early organ-specific molecular responses to NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3. Using this experimental and computational approach, we gained an unbiased view of the NAE 18:2- and NAE 18:3-modulated transcriptome changes that are activated and lead to downstream changes in seedling development. NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 induced the expression of several genes also induced by ABA or chitin treatment. The overlap with ABA-response genes corroborates previously work; however, this is the first time chitin-response genes have been identified as part of the NAE-modulation of seedling growth. Overall, the bioinformatic analyses presented here supports the hypothesis that NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 elicit organ-specific and signal- specific molecular changes that precede developmental changes in Arabidopsis seedlings. Further, these data provide novel insights into the genetic programs that are modulated by NAE 18:2 and NAE 18:3 at the organ-specific level in Arabidopsis seedlings, and will facilitate future studies of the corresponding signaling networks.
Overall design: Intact seedlings and dissected cotyledon and root mRNA profiles of  3-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings treated with DMSO, 40 µM NAE 18:2 or 80 µM NAE 18:3  were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using the Illumina Next-Seq 500 system.

In comparison to their bacterial and mitochondrial counterparts, the biogenesis of plastid ribosomes is less well understood and few auxiliary factors have been described so far. In this study, we report the functional characterization of CGL20 (CONSERVED ONLY IN THE GREEN LINEAGE20) in Arabidopsis thaliana (AtCGL20) a small, proline-rich protein which is targeted to mitochondria and chloroplasts. In Arabidopsis, CGL20 is encoded by segmentally duplicated genes of high similarity (AtCGL20A and AtCGL20B), and inactivation of both in the atcgl20ab mutant leads to a visible virescent phenotype, and growth arrest at low temperature. The chloroplast proteome, thylakoid complex abundance and pigment composition are significantly affected in atcgl20ab mutants, resulting in a combined proton gradient regulation (pgr) and chlororespiratory reduction (crr) phenotype. Loss of AtCGL20 alters plastid rRNA ratios, perturbs the formation of a hidden break in 23S rRNA and causes abnormal accumulation of 50S ribosomal subunits in the high-molecular-mass fraction of chloroplast stromal extracts. Moreover, AtCGL20A-eGFP fusion proteins comigrate with 50S ribosomal subunits in sucrose density gradients, even after RNase treatment of stromal extracts. Therefore, we propose that AtCGL20 participates in late stages of the biogenesis of 50S ribosomal subunits in plastids – a role which presumably evolved in the green lineage as a consequence of structural divergence of plastid ribosomes.

PRJNA551415	The jasmonate-response genome regulatory program is defined by the direct targets of transcription factors MYC2 and MYC3, chromatin modification and gene expression changes (thale cress)	"The hormone jasmonic acid (JA) controls a plethora of crucially important processes in plants through a signaling pathway orchestrated by the transcription factor MYC2 and its closest relatives. Understanding the systems-level actions of transcription factors provides insight into how the genome is reprogrammed in response to environmental stimuli. However, deeper biological insight can be obtained if transcription factor activity is set in the broader regulatory context of the cell and the downstream organismal phenotypes the transcription factors control. Here, we have investigated the MYC2-governed genome regulatory network that controls JA responses in Arabidopsis thaliana etiolated seedlings. We have generated an integrated framework of the response to JA that spans from the activity of master and secondary-regulatory transcription factors, through gene expression outputs and alternative splicing to protein abundance changes, protein phosphorylation and chromatin remodeling. We have integrated time series transcriptome analysis with (phospho)proteomic data using gene regulatory network models. These enable us to predict previously unknown points of crosstalk from JA to other signaling pathways and to identify new components of the JA regulatory mechanism, which we validated through targeted mutant studies. The result is a comprehensive understanding of how a plant hormone remodels cellular function and plant behavior, the general principles of which provide a framework for analysis of cross-regulation between other hormone and stress signaling pathways.

PRJNA556000	A Phase-Separated Nuclear GBPL Circuit Controls Immunity in Plants (thale cress)	"Liquid-liquid phase separation (LLPS) has emerged as a central paradigm for understanding how membrane-less organelles compartmentalize diverse cellular activities in eukaryotes. Here, we identified a new superfamily of plant Guanylate Binding Protein-Like GTPases (GBPLs) that assemble LLPS-driven condensates within the nucleus to protect against infection and autoimmunity. In Arabidopsis thaliana, two family members - GBPL1 and GBPL3 - undergo phase transition behavior to control transcriptional responses as part of an allosteric switch triggered by exposure to biotic stress. GBPL1, a pseudoGTPase, sequesters catalytically-active GBPL3 under basal conditions but is displaced by LLPS when GBPL3 enters the nucleus following immune cues to drive formation of unique membrane-less organelles termed GDACs (GBPL Defense-Activated Condensates) that we visualized by in situ cryo-electron tomography. Within these mesoscale GDAC structures, native GBPL3 directly bound defense gene promoters and recruited specific transcriptional coactivators of the Mediator complex plus RNA Pol II machinery to massively reprogram host gene expression for disease resistance. Together, our study identifies a new GBPL circuit that reinforces the biological importance of phase-separated condensates, in this case, as indispensable players in plant defense.

Methods: A total amount of 3 μg RNA was used for generation of sequencing libraries using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Clean reads were obtained by removing low quality reads, reads containing adapter and ploy-N from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content the clean data were calculated. Index of the Arabidopsis genome was built using Bowtie v2.2.3 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene. And then FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced) of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of drought stress versus control condition was performed using the DESeq R package (1.18.0).
Results:In total, four samples with three biological replicates per genotype/treatment combination were used for RNA sequencing analysis. At least 2 G clean bases were generated for each sample.

PRJNA558574	The ARID1-AGO9 complex orchestrates easiRNA movement during sperm maturation in Arabidopsis [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"We identified 211 TEs that were significantly upregulated in arid1 and ago9 mutants, with two biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology.
Sperm maturation triggers the reactivation of heterochromatic transposable elements (TEs) in the companion vegetative cell, which results in easiRNA (epigenetically reactivated siRNA) production to silence TEs in sperm via movement in pollen. How easiRNA movement is initiated during sperm maturation and when TEs are reactivated are open questions. Here, we report that TE reactivation initiates after the first asymmetric pollen mitosis and the shuttle-localized transcription factor ARID1 triggers easiRNA movement by associating with AGO9 from the vegetative cell to sperm. Dysfunction of both ARID1 and AGO9 causes over-reactivation of a subset of heterochromatic TEs in pollen. Mechanistically, ARID1 interacts with AGO9, in which ARID1 facilitates the recruitment of AGO9 to TE chromatin and instead AGO9 regulates the transient localization of ARID1 in the generative nucleus. Moreover, ARID1-bound easiRNAs are highly overlapped with those of AGO9, and the association of ARID1 with easiRNA is AGO9-dependent. In consequence, mutations of both ARID1 and AGO9 attenuate easiRNA movement from the vegetative cell to germline cells, thus finally leading to de-repression of TE in sperm. Collectively, these results fill the gap how siRNAs move in gametes and uncover a delicate collaboration between a gametic-specific transcription factor and AGOs to maintain genome integrity during fertilization.

PRJNA559405	CDK8 is associated with RAP2.6 and SnRK2.6 and positively modulates abscisic acid signaling and drought response in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"CDK8 is a key subunit of Mediator complex, a large multiprotein complex that is a fundamental part of the conserved eukaryotic transcriptional machinery. However, the biological functions of CDK8 in plant abiotic stress responses remain largely unexplored. Here, we demonstrated CDK8 as a critical regulator in the abscisic acid (ABA) signaling and drought response pathways in Arabidopsis. Compared to wild-type, cdk8 mutants showed reduced sensitivity to ABA, impaired stomatal apertures and hypersensitivity to drought stress. Transcriptomic and chromatin immunoprecipitation analysis revealed that CDK8 positively regulates the transcription of several ABA-responsive genes, probably through promoting the recruitment of RNA polymerase II to their promoters. We discovered that both CDK8 and SnRK2.6 interact physically with an ERF/AP2 transcription factor RAP2.6, which can directly bind to the promoters of RD29A and COLD-REGULATED 15A (COR15A) with GCC or DRE elements, thereby promoting their expression. Importantly, we also showed that CDK8 is essential for the ABA-induced expression of RAP2.6 and RAP2.6-mediated upregulation of ABA-responsive genes, indicating that CDK8 could link the SnRK2.6-mediated ABA signaling to RNA polymerase II to promote immediate transcriptional response to ABA and drought signals. Overall, our data provide new insights into the roles of CDK8 in modulating ABA signaling and drought responses.
Overall design: RNA-Seq of 4 samples, each has 3 replicates.

PRJNA433501	Impact of G-content on Arabidopsis AtPAB binding and their role in enhancing translational efficiency (thale cress)	"Polyadenylation plays a key role in producing mature mRNAs in eukaryotes. It is widely believed that the poly(A)-binding proteins (PABs) uniformly bind to poly(A)-tailed mRNAs, regulating their stability and translational efficiency. Here, we characterized the RNA-binding landscape of three broadly expressed PABs in Arabidopsis thaliana. We observed substantial variation in the AtPAB-binding efficiency among mRNAs, which can be partly explained by the guanosine (G) content of poly(A) tails. AtPAB-binding efficiency of a gene was positively associated with translational efficiency rather than mRNA stability. Consistently, genes with stronger AtPAB binding exhibited a greater reduction in translational efficiency when AtPAB is depleted. Our study provides a new mechanism that translational efficiency of a gene can be regulated through G-content-dependent PAB binding, paving the way for a better understanding of poly(A) tail-associated regulation of gene expression.

PRJNA560784	Plant 22-nt siRNAs mediate translational repression and stress adaptation (thale cress)	"Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are critical for proper development and immunity in eukaryotes1. Plants produce siRNAs with lengths of 21-, 22-, or 24- nucleotides (nt), wherein the 21- and 24-nt siRNAs mediate mRNA cleavage and DNA methylation2,3, respectively. However, the biological functions of 22-nt siRNAs remain elusive. Here we report the identification and characterization of a group of endogenous 22-nt siRNAs generated from the action of DICER-LIKE 2 (DCL2). When cytoplasmic RNA decay and DCL4 are deficient, the massive accumulation of 22-nt siRNAs causes pleiotropic growth disorders, including severe dwarfism, meristem defect, and pigmentation. Notably, two genes that encode nitrate reductases, NIA1 and NIA2, produce nearly half of the total of 22-nt siRNAs. Production of 22-nt siRNA triggers explosive self-amplification that leads to a small RNA storm, and induces dramatic translational repression both gene-specifically and globally. 22-nt siRNAs are also found to preferentially accumulate upon nitrogen deficiency, which acts to restrain plant growth and promote stress responses. Thus, our research uncovers the unique properties of 22-nt siRNAs, a previously unexplored class of plant siRNAs, and highlights the length of small RNA as a major functional determinant.

PRJNA561509	A chemical and synthetic biology approach to control plant membrane receptor kinase signaling (thale cress)	"Plants have a large family of membrane receptor kinases (RKs) which sense extracellular signals to control plant growth, development, immunity, and stress response. The largest group of RKs contains an extracellular leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domain with over 200 members in Arabidopsis. However, the functional understanding of most of the LRR-RKs has been hampered by their genetic redundancy and the subtle phenotypes of RK overexpression. Here we show that the rapamycin-mediated heterodimerization of chimeric cytosolic kinase domains from receptor/co-receptor pairs in the plasma membrane can activate their downstream cellular signaling pathway, inducing the specific biological responses, including brassinosteroid, plant immunity, stomatal development, and lateral root development. This chemically controlled synthetic biology approach will be useful to investigate biological functions of LRR-RKs and their signaling pathways.

The cell wall leucine-rich repeat extensins LRX3/4/5, the RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALF) peptides RALF22/23, and FERONIA (FER) function as a module to regulate plant growth and salt stress responses via the sense of cell wall integrity. However, the intracellular signaling pathways that mediate the effects of the LRX3/4/5-RALF22/23-FER module are still largely unknown. Here, we report that jasmonic acid (JA), salicylic acid (SA), and abscisic acid (ABA) accumulate constitutively in lrx345 and fer mutants. Blocking JA pathway rescues the retarded growth phenotype of the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, while disruption of ABA biosynthesis suppresses the salt-hypersensitivity of these mutants. Many salt stress-responsive genes display abnormal expression patterns in the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, as well as in wild type plants treated with epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG), an inhibitor of pectin methylesterases, suggesting that the cell wall integrity is a critical factor that determines the expression of stress-responsive genes. Production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) is constitutively increased in the lrx345 and fer-4 mutants, and inhibition of ROS accumulation suppresses the salt-hypersensitivity of these mutants. Together, our results suggest that the LRX3/4/5-RALF22/23-FER module controls plant growth and salt stress responses by regulating hormonal homeostasis and ROS accumulation.

Here, we used steady-state RNA sequencing methods in mutants defective in nuclear RNA decay, including by the exosome, to reassess the existence of PROMPTs in A. thaliana. While PROMPTs are overall rare in A. thaliana, about 100 clear cases of exosome-sensitive PROMPTs were identified. We also found that PROMPTs become sources of 21-22 nt small interfering RNAs in exosome-deficient mutants, perhaps explaining why plants have evolved mechanisms to suppress PROMPT production.

PRJNA484887	Widespread EJC footprints in the RNA degradome mark mRNA degradation before steady-state translation (thale cress)	"Exon junction complexes (EJCs) are deposited to mRNAs during splicing and displaced from mRNAs by ribosomes in the pioneer round of translation. The understanding of EJC-bound mRNA degradation before steady-state translation has been limited to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (NMD) due to a lack of suitable methodologies. Here, we show that RNA degradome data of Arabidopsis, rice, worm and human cells all exhibit a predominant accumulation of 5′ monophosphate (5′P) ends in the canonical EJC region. Inhibition of 5′-3′ exoribonuclease activity and overexpression of an EJC disassembly factor in Arabidopsis reduced the 5′P ends accumulating in the EJC region, supporting the notion that these 5′P ends are in vivo EJC footprints. Hundreds of Arabidopsis NMD targets possess evident EJC footprints, validating their degradation during the pioneer round of translation. In addition to premature termination codons, plant microRNAs can also direct the degradation of EJC-bound mRNAs. However, the production of EJC footprints from NMD but not microRNA targets is dependent on an NMD factor, SMG7. Together, our finding demonstrating in vivo EJC footprinting unravels the composition of the RNA degradome, and provides a new avenue for studying NMD and other mechanisms, such as microRNAs, targeting EJC-bound mRNAs for degradation before steady-state translation.

PRJNA563854	Polymerase IV Plays a Crucial Role in Pollen Development in Capsella	"In Arabidopsis thaliana, DNA-dependent RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for the formation of transposable element (TE)-derived small RNA (sRNA) transcripts. These transcripts are processed by DICER-LIKE3 into 24-nt small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that guide RNA-directed DNA methylation. In the pollen grain, Pol IV is also required for the accumulation of 21/22-nt epigenetically activated siRNAs (easiRNAs), which likely silence TEs via post-transcriptional mechanisms. Despite this proposed role of Pol IV, its loss of function in Arabidopsis does not cause a discernable pollen defect. Here, we show that the knockout of NRPD1, encoding the largest subunit of Pol IV in the Brassicaceae species Capsella rubella, caused post-meiotic arrest of pollen development at the microspore stage. As in Arabidopsis, all TE-derived siRNAs were 2 depleted in Capsella nrpd1 microspores. In the wild-type background, the same TEs produced 21/22-nt and 24-nt siRNAs; these processes required Pol IV activity. Arrest of Capsella nrpd1 microspores was accompanied by the deregulation of genes targeted by Pol IV-dependent siRNAs. TEs were much closer to genes in Capsella rubella compared to Arabidopsis thaliana, perhaps explaining the essential role of Pol IV in pollen development in Capsella. Our discovery that Pol IV is functionally required in Capsella microspores emphasizes the relevance of investigating different plant models.

PRJNA564640	Identification of BBX proteins as rate-limiting co-factors of HY5 (thale cress)	"As a source of both energy and environmental information, the importance for plants to monitor the incoming light is evidenced by the highly integrated nature of the light signal transduction pathway with numerous other pathways throughout plant development. One of these signal integrators is the bZIP transcription factor HY5 which holds a key role as a positive regulator of light signalling in plants. Although HY5 is described to act as a DNA-binding transcriptional regulator, the lack of any apparent transactivation domain makes it unclear how HY5 is able to accomplish its many functions. We describe the identification of three B-box containing proteins (BBX20, 21 and 22) as essential partners for HY5 dependent modulation of hypocotyl elongation, anthocyanin accumulation and transcriptional regulation. The bbx202122 triple mutant mimics the phenotypes of hy5 in the light and its strong suppression of the cop1 phenotype in darkness. Furthermore, RNA-seq experiments show that 84% of genes differentially regulated in bbx202122 are also HY5 regulated, consistent with the B-box proteins and HY5 acting interdependently.

PRJNA564817	Salicylic Acid Suppresses Apical Hook Formation via NPR1-Mediated Repression of EIN3/EIL1 in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Salicylic acid (SA) and ethylene (ET) are two important plant hormones that regulate numerous plant growth, development, and stress response processes. Previous studies have suggested functional interplay of SA and ET in defense response, but precisely how these two hormones co-regulate plant growth and development processes remains unclear. The present findings reveal an antagonism between SA and ET in apical hook formation, a process that ensures successful soil emergence of dicotyledonous etiolated seedlings. Exogenous SA inhibited the ET-induced expression of HOOKLESS1 (HLS1) in a manner dependent on ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE3 (EIN3)/EIN3-LIKE1 (EIL1), the core transcription factors in the ET signaling pathway. We found that SA-activated NONEXPRESSER OF PR GENES1 (NPR1) physically interacted with EIN3 and interfered with the direct binding of EIN3 to target gene promoters, including the HLS1 promoter. Transcriptomic analysis further revealed that NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 coordinately regulated subsets of genes that mediate plant growth and stress responses, suggesting that the interaction between NPR1 and EIN3/EIL1 might be an important mechanism for integrating the SA and ET signaling pathways in multiple physiological processes. Taken together, our findings shed light on the molecular mechanism underlying SA regulation of apical hook formation as well as the antagonism between SA and ET in early seedling establishment and possibly other physiological processes.

PRJNA504886	DNA methylation and histone H1 jointly repress transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts (thale cress)	"DNA methylation and histone H1 mediate transcriptional silencing of genes and transposable elements, but how they interact is unclear. In plants and animals with mosaic genomic methylation, functionally mysterious methylation is also common within constitutively active housekeeping genes. Here we show that H1 is enriched in methylated sequences, including genes, of Arabidopsis thaliana, yet this enrichment is independent of DNA methylation. Loss of H1 disperses heterochromatin, globally alters nucleosome organization, and activates H1-bound genes, but only weakly de-represses transposable elements. However, H1 loss strongly activates transposable elements hypomethylated through mutation of DNA methyltransferase MET1. Hypomethylation of genes also activates antisense transcription, which is enhanced by H1 loss. Our results demonstrate that H1 and DNA methylation jointly maintain transcriptional homeostasis by silencing transposable elements and aberrant intragenic transcripts. Such functionality plausibly explains why DNA methylation, a well-known mutagen, has been maintained within coding sequences of crucial plant and animal genes.
Overall design: Bisulfite and RNA sequencing was performed using wt, h1, met1, h1met1, h1;met1 +/- plants (5-6 replicates, one sample for h1;met1 +/-) to examine the effect of DNA methylation and histone H1 loss on RNA expression.

The global gene expression analysis of the necrotic cell death and HR cell death developed in cucumber mosaic virus-inoculated leaves of A. thaliana was performed by RNA-seq, respectively. The samples for RNA-seq were collected from the cell death leaves showing HR cell death at 3dpi and showing necrotic cell death at 5dpi, respectively. The sequence data was first preprocessed by FASTQ in basespace of illumine.The sequence reads were processed with Trimmomatic (version 0.38) for adaptor trimming and quality trimming. The processed reads were mapped to the genome sequences of A.thaliana ecotype Col-0, CMV(Y) and CMV(Ho) with STAR (version 2.7) with its default settings. Read counts per each A.thaliana gene were retrieved by the quantification option of STAR. The obtained read counts were normalized and statistically tested using DESeq2 R package 3.7. Adjusted p-values were calculated with Benjamini-Hochberg procedure, and the threshold for adjusted p-value was set to 0.05 in the present study. The independent filtering in DESeq2 was performed to filter out the genes with low mean normalized counts, with an automatically optimized threshold; 5,906 genes which passed the independent filtering in both of the two comparisons (i.e, necrotic cell death vs mock and HR cell death vs control) were further analyzed for differential expression. Genes with adjusted p-value of <0.05 and a fold change of >4 or <0.25 were considered as DEGs. Of the 5,906 genes analyzed, 202 genes showed >4-fold up-regulation upon either HR cell death or necrotic cell death induction (adjusted p < 0.05).

PRJNA566150	Comparison of transcript profiles of Arabidopsis WT and VPZ plants to fluctuating light and high light (thale cress)	"Purpose: Overexpression of VDE, ZEP and PsbS (VPZ) in plants confers enhanced dynamics of non-photochemical quenching of NPQ under FL light. VPZ overexpression in tobacco has been reported to increase plant biomass under fluctuating light. However, our work demonstrates that such strategy had no advantageous effect when asssayed in Arabidopsis thaliana. To investigate whether this observation is due to  impairements in signaling pathways due to the expression of VPZ in Arabidopsis thaliana, transcriptome profiles of VPZ plants exposed to fluctuating light or high light were conducted.
Methods: mRNA-Seq libraries were prepared from 21-d-old Col0 plants and VPZ lines #2 and #4  cultivated under standard control conditions and then exposed to fluctuating light or high light for 6h and 30 h.  Standard Illumina protocols were used for mRNA-Seq sequencing. Triplicates for 3 independent plants were used. Adaptor sequences were removed with Trimmomatic and resulting reads mapped to the Arabidopsis genome (Araport11) with Tophat 2.1.1. Normalised counts reads were quantified with featureCounts to provide processed data files and differential expression analysis were conducted with the DEseq2 pipeline.
Results: mRNA-Seq libraries contained app. 9 milion reads each. Transcript analysis for differential gene expression was conducted according to the Tophat/featureCounts/DESeq2 pipeline. To declare significant differences, a cut-off for absolute log2(FC) ≥ 1 compared to the initial timepoint (0h) and FDR ≤ 0.05 was applied. Significant transcripts exclusively found for Col0 and both VPZ lines in each time-point were considered for subsequent analysis. Accordingly,  528 and 415 transcripts (6h and 30h) were found for Col0, and 326 and 896  (6h and 30h) for the VPZ under control conditions. For FL, 490 and 591 transcripts qualified as specific  (6h and 30h) for Col0 and 938 and 401 (6h and 30h) for VPZ. Strikingly, the amount of transcripts raised to 2847 and 2902 DEGs (6h and 30h) for Col0, whereas only 546 and 304  (6h and 30h) were detected for VPZ under HL. transcripts).
Conclusions: the overexpression of VPZ in Arabidopsis leads to particular transcriptome response under fluctuating light related to changes in photosynthesis and response to abscisic acid, among all. However, Col0 displayed wider transcriptome responses than VPZ after exposure to high light .

Methods: Transcriptional and posttranscritional profiles were identified and characterized for Arabidopsis seedlings grown under continuous light or long-day condition (16 h light/8 h dark) for one day (each condition has two biological replicates).
Results: We show that rhythmic posttranscriptional regulation is also a significant factor for genome-wide profile of circadian plant transcriptome. Two major posttranscriptioal mechanisms alternative splicing (AS) and alternative polyadenylation (APA) show circadian rhythmicity, resulting from the oscillation in the genes invovled in AS and APA.

PRJNA573713	Targeted reprogramming of H3K27me3 resets epigenetic memory in plant paternal chromatin [mature pollen] (thale cress)	"Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the gametes to reset genomic potential in the next generation. In most animal species, paternal chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation and the exchange of histones with protamine. Precisely how the paternal epigenome is reprogrammed in flowering plants remains unclear since sperm chromatin is not demethylated and histones are retained. Here, we show that the sperm-specific histone, H3.10, is immune to lysine 27 methylation and that its deposition in sperm contributes to the global and specific resetting of the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 by uncoupling its inheritance during DNA replication. The loss of H3K27me3 facilitates transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis and pre-configures sperm with a chromatin state that forecasts gene expression in the next generation, revealing a global wave of epigenetic resetting that coordinates with early plant life. Thus, in contrast to the indiscriminate removal of epigenetic marks in animal sperm, plants have evolved a specific mechanism to simultaneously differentiate male gametes and reprogram the paternal epigenome.

PRJNA575031	Dual RNA-seq analysis unveils Trichoderma NoxR as an essential mediator of the molecular dialogue during interaction with Arabidopsis	"Trichoderma species promote growth and strengthen immunity of Arabidopsis and crop species through multiple mechanisms. However, how fungal proteins mediate growth-defense tradeoffs is unknown. We analyzed the growth, root architecture, defense and global gene expression profiles in Arabidopsis seedlings co-cultivated with T. atroviride WT, and Δnox1, Δnox2, and ΔnoxR mutants, defective on the catalytic and regulatory subunits of NADPH oxidase, respectively. The gene expression profile in the fungus was also characterized in standard growth conditions and in the presence of plants.  The results revealed the critical role of Trichoderma NoxR in mediating growth-defense tradeoffs in Arabidopsis. The effects of T. atroviride WT in improving root branching and biomass production decreased in all three related NADPH defective mutants, particularly in ΔnoxR. In contrast, induction of jasmonic acid-related defense responses in roots and shoots were exacerbated in ΔnoxR compared to the WT strain. Transcriptome analyses showed a tight plant-fungus communication based on reactive oxygen species and availability of carbon resources. The ΔnoxR is unable to perceive changes in nutrient sources and activate signaling cascades, which suppresses the metabolic change from saprophyte to commensal. Thus we conclude that Trichoderma NoxR orchestrates fungal-induced development and defense tradeoffs in Arabidopsis and plays an important role in cross-kingdom plant-fungus communication.

PRJNA578665	Arabidopsis requires a stearoyl-ACP desaturase for proper interaction with beneficial rhizobacteria (thale cress)	"Unlike pathogens that trigger plant defense responses, beneficial microbes are compatible with plants. One possible reason for the compatibility is that the microbial factors from beneficial microbes are inert in that they do not trigger plant defense responses. Little is known about the mechanisms underlying this seemingly inert relation. Here we report that Arabidopsis lacking the gene Growth-Promotion 1 (GP1) becomes defensive to microbial volatiles from Bacillus amyloliqueficiens strain GB03, a beneficial rhizobacterium. The gp1 mutant was isolated in a forward genetic screen for mutants that show defectiveness in GB03-triggered plant inducible vigor. GP1 encodes a stearoyl-ACP desaturase that catalyzes the desaturation of stearic acid (18:0) to oleic acid (18:1). Consistently, plant inducible vigor was also impaired by chemical enhancement of 18:1 catabolism, while genetic disruption of 18:1 catabolism largely restored the inducible vigor in gp1. When exposed to GB03-emitted microbial volatiles (GMVs), wild type plants showed transcriptional up-regulation of growth-promoting processes and down-regulation of defense responses; in contrast, the gp1 transcriptome displayed elevated defense responses when treated with GMVs. Meanwhile disruption of salicylic acid-mediated defense partially restored plant inducible vigor in gp1. Microbiota profiling revealed that GP1 dysfunction alters the assemblage of plant-associated rhizobacteria communities, including a reduction in the Bacillaceae family that is known to contain many beneficial rhizobacteria species. Consistently, gp1 mutants showed severely impaired root colonization of GB03. Our findings suggest that GP1 prevents the plant defense system from being mistakenly activated by non-pathogenic microbial factors, thereby allowing mutualistic association between the plant and beneficial microbes.

VIP3 belongs to polymerase II-associated factor 1 complex (Paf1c), which is involved in several RNA polymerase II-dependent transcriptional processes. Arabidopsis vip3 mutants exhibit phylotactic defects and strong floral indeterminacy phenotypes.
Overall design: Material for the RNA-seq was collected from the primary inflorescence of vip3-1 and Col-0 shoot apices (from plants grown in short day 21°C then continuous light 16°C conditions). Apices were dissected, by removing flower older than stage 4. Samples were collected into liquid nitrogen-cooled eppendorf tubes directly after dissection, each tube containing between 30 and 35 apices, 6 samples for each genotype. RNA extraction was performed using the PicoPure RNA Isolation kit Arcturus (ThermoFisher, KIT0204) with an on column DNAase treatment (Qiagen, catalog#79254).

PRJNA579165	PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTORs trigger environmentally responsive chromatin dynamics (thale cress)	"The pivotal interplay between light receptors and PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTORs (PIFs) serves as an essential regulatory hub that perceives and integrates environmental cues into the plant’s transcriptional networks. A critical control component of environmentally-responsive gene networks is the histone variant H2A.Z which provides transcriptional plasticity and prevents undesired gene activation. However, the functional relationship between PIF transcription factors (TFs) and H2A.Z is despite their outstanding importance, only poorly understood. Here, we describe a photo-genomic approach that utilizes the rapid and reversible light-mediated manipulation of PIF7 activity to visualize PIF7 DNA binding and H2A.Z occupancy kinetics on a genome-wide scale. Strikingly, we discovered that PIF shape the H2A.Z landscape in a light quality-dependent manner. We found that DNA binding of PIF7 is not regulated by H2A.Z but most importantly, PIFs initiate H2A.Z eviction and through the direct interaction with EIN6 ENHANCER (EEN), a crucial subunit of INO80 chromatin remodeling complex. Collectively, we describe a PIF-INO80 regulatory module that controls plant growth in response to environmental changes.

PRJNA580447	Transcriptomic analysis revealed adverse effect of melatonin on root growth (thale cress)	"Purpose: We aimed to compare transcriptomic changes after high concentration melatonin treatment in Arabidopsis
Methods: A total amount of 3 μg RNA was used for generation of sequencing libraries using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Clean reads were obtained by removing low quality reads, reads containing adapter and ploy-N from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content the clean data were calculated. Index of the Arabidopsis genome was built using Bowtie v2.2.3 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene. And then FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced) of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of drought stress versus control condition was performed using the DESeq R package (1.18.0).
Results:In total, eight samples with two biological replicates per genotype/treatment combination were used for RNA sequencing analysis. At least 2 G clean bases were generated for each sample.

PRJNA586757	Dual recognition of H3K4me3 and DNA by the ISWI component ARID5 regulates floral phase transition in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Chromatin remodeling and histone modifications are important for development and floral phase transition in plants. However, it is largely unknown whether and how these two epigenetic regulators coordinately regulate the important biological processes. Here, we identified three types of ISWI chromatin remodeling complexes in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that ARID5, a subunit of a plant-specific ISWI complex, can regulate development and floral phase transition. The ARID-PHD dual domain cassette of ARID5 recognizes both the H3K4me3 histone mark and AT-rich DNA. We determined the ternary complex structure of the ARID5 ARID-PHD cassette with an H3K4me3 peptide and an AT-containing DNA. The H3K4me3 peptide is combinatorially recognized by the PHD and ARID domains, while the DNA is specifically recognized by the ARID domain. Both PHD and ARID domains are necessary for the association of ARID5 with chromatin. The results suggest that the dual recognition of AT-rich DNA and H3K4me3 by the ARID5 ARID-PHD cassette may facilitate the association of the ISWI complex with specific chromatin regions to regulate development and floral phase transition

PRJNA587008	Rocks in the Auxin Stream: Wound induced auxin accumulation and ERF115 expression synergistically drive stem cell regeneration (thale cress)	"Plants are known for their outstanding capacity for recovering from various wounds and injury. However, it remains largely unknown how plants sense diverse forms of injury and canalize existing developmental processes into the execution of a correct regenerative response. Auxin, a cardinal plant hormone with morphogenlike properties, has been previously implicated in recovery from diverse types of wounding and organ loss. Here, through a combination of cellular imaging and in silico modelling, we demonstrate that vascular stem cell death obstructs the polar auxin flux, much alike rocks in a stream, and causes it to accumulate in the endodermis. This in turn grants the endodermal cells the capacity to undergo periclinal cell division that repopulate the vascular stem cell pool. Replenishment of the vasculature by the endodermis depends on the transcription factor ERF115, a wound inducible regulator of stem cell divisions. Although not being the primary inducer, auxin is required to maintain ERF115 expression. Reversely, ERF115 sensitizes cells to auxin by activating ARF5/MONOPTEROS, an auxin responsive transcription factor involved in the global auxin response, tissue patterning and organ formation. Combined, the wound induced auxin accumulation and ERF115 expression grant the endodermal cells stem cell activity. Our work provides a mechanistic model for wound induced stem cell regeneration in which ERF115 acts as a wound-inducible stem cell organizer that interprets wound-induced auxin maxima.

PRJNA587623	RNA-Seq Analysis of Wild Type and pSTK::amiRNACWIN24 (4-3) Transcriptomes (thale cress)	"Ovule formation is essential for realizing crop yield as it determines seed number. The underlying molecular mechanism, however, remains elusive. Here, we show that cell wall invertase (CWIN) functions as a positive regulator of ovule initiation in Arabidopsis. In situ hybridization revealed that CWIN2 and CWIN4 were expressed at the placenta region where ovule primordia initiated. Specific silencing of CWIN2 and 4 by using targeted artificial microRNA driven by an ovule-specific SEEDSTICK promoter (pSTK) resulted in a significant reduction of CWIN transcript and activity, which blocked ovule initiation and aggravated ovule abortion. Surprisingly, there was no induction of carbon starvation genes in the transgenic lines and supplement of extra carbon to newly forming floral buds failed to recover the ovule phenotype. The findings indicate that suppression of CWIN did not lead to carbon starvation. Interestingly, a group of hexose transporters was downregulated in the transgenic plants and two representative transporter genes, STP9 and SWEET8 were spatially co-expressed with CWIN2 and CWIN4, suggesting a coupling between CWIN and hexose transporters for ovule initiation. RNA-Seq analysis identified differentially expressed genes encoding putative extracellular receptor-like-kinases (RLKs), MADS-box transcription factors including STK and early auxin response genes, SAURs, in response to CWIN-silencing. Collectively, our data demonstrate the essential role that CWIN plays in ovule initiation likely through sugar signalling instead of carbon nutrient contribution. We propose that CWIN-mediated sugar signalling may be perceived by, and transmitted through, hexose transporters or RLKs to regulate ovule formation by modulating downstream auxin signalling and MADS-box transcription factors.
Overall design: To explore the underlying basis of CWIN-mediated ovule initiation, RNA-seq was conducted to compare the transcript profiles of flower buds pooled from stage 8 to 10 in a representative transgenic line, 4-3 and WT.

Low Mg status reportedly impacts on photosynthesis, sucrose partitioning and biomass allocation. However, earlier responses to Mg deficiency are scarcely described. Generally, symptoms of nutrient deficiency appear in specific ages of leaves. Therefore, we hypothesised that transcriptional responses to Mg deficiency are different depending on the ages of leaves, and performed a global transcriptomic analysis in two types of leaves; source and sink leaves of the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana to reveal the earlier responses to Mg deficiency. The global transcriptomic study revealed that short-term Mg deficiency triggers the expression of defence response genes in sink leaves. In roots, although short-term Mg deficiency enhanced the Mg2+ uptake from the environmnet, transcriptional levels of genes encoding putative Mg2+ transporters in roots were unchanged, suggesting non-transcriptional regulation of Mg2+ uptake in roots.

PRJNA588414	Intronic long noncoding RNAs activate host gene expression by affecting histone modification in Arabidopsis (RNA-seq) (thale cress)	"Intronic RNAs are spliced from precursor-messenger RNAs and are usually subjected to degradation in eukaryotes. COLDAIR, a previously reported intronic long noncoding RNA (lncRNA), is produced from the first intron of a MADS-box gene, Flowering Locus C (FLC), which encodes a repressor of flowering time. Here we show that overexpression of a foreign COLDAIR sequence causes enhanced expression of FLC in trans, resulting in a late-flowering phenotype. In COLDAIR-overexpression lines, enhanced expression of FLC is correlated with up-regulation of the active histone mark H3K4me3 and down-regulation of the repressive histone mark H3K27me3. We demonstrate that overexpression of COLDAIR makes the corresponding FLC intronic region accessible to the histone H3K4 methyltransferase ATX1 but exclusive to the histone H3K27 methyltransferase CLF. Furthermore, we demonstrate that overexpression of intronic lncRNAs from many other MADS-box genes also activate the expression of their host genes in trans, suggesting that intronic lncRNAs act as enhancer RNAs in many MADS-box genes.

Methods: Seedling mRNA profiles of 4-day-old Arabidopsis seedlings treated with DMSO or 40 µM NAE 18:3 for 1 h or 3 h were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate, using the Illumina Next-Seq 500 system. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed using STAR followed by DESeq2. qRT–PCR validation was performed using SYBR Green assays.
Results: We show that the activity of N-linolenoylethanolamine (NAE 18:3) requires an intact G-protein complex; specifically, genetic ablation of the Gβ dimer or loss of the full set of atypical G⍺ subunits strongly attenuates an NAE 18:3 de-greening of cotyledons in Arabidopsis seedlings. This effect involves, at least in part, transcriptional regulation of chlorophyll synthesis gene expression. In addition, there is feedforward transcriptional control of G-protein signaling components and G-protein interactors.
Conclusions: These results are consistent with NAE 18:3 being a lipid signaling molecule in plants with a requirement for G-proteins to mediate signal transduction, a situation similar, but not identical, to the action of NAE endocannabinoids in animal systems.

PRJNA589282	Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 3 Fine-Tunes the Assembly/Disassembly of Pre-ribosomes to Repress Nucleolar Stress by Interacting with RPS2B in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Ribosome biogenesis, which takes place mainly in the nucleolus, involves coordinated expression of pre-ribosomal RNAs (pre-rRNAs) and ribosomal proteins, pre-rRNA processing, and subunit assembly with the aid of numerous assembly factors. Our previous study showed that the Arabidopsis thaliana protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT3 regulates pre-rRNA processing; however, the underlying molecular mechanism remains unknown. Here, we report that AtPRMT3 interacts with Ribosomal Protein S2 (RPS2), facilitating processing of the 90S/Small Subunit (SSU) processome and repressing nucleolar stress. We isolated an intragenic suppressor of atprmt3-2, which rescues the developmental defects of atprmt3-2 while produces a putative truncated AtPRMT3 protein bearing the entire N-terminus but lacking an intact enzymatic activity domain. We further identified RPS2 as an interacting partner of AtPRMT3, and found that loss-of-function rps2a2b mutants were phenotypically reminiscent of atprmt3, showing pleiotropic developmental defects and aberrant pre-rRNA processing. RPS2B binds directly to pre-rRNAs in the nucleus, and such binding is enhanced in atprmt3-2. Consistently, multiple components of the 90S/SSU processome were more enriched by RPS2B in atprmt3-2, which accounts for early pre-rRNA processing defects and results in nucleolar stress. Collectively, our study uncovered a novel mechanism by which AtPRMT3 cooperates with RPS2B to facilitate the dynamic assembly/disassembly of the 90S/SSU processome during ribosome biogenesis and repress nucleolar stress.

PRJNA589627	PRC2-mediated epigenetic signatures associate with pathogn-induced programmed cell death in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is well-known for its role in controlling developmental transitions by suppressing the premature expression of key developmental regulators. Previous work revealed that PRC2 also controls the onset of senescence, a form of developmental programmed cell death (PCD) in plants. Whether the induction of PCD in response to stress is similarly suppressed by the PRC2 remained largely unknown. In this study, we explored whether PCD triggered in response to immunity- and disease-promoting pathogen effectors is associated with changes in the distribution of the PRC2-mediated H3K27me3 histone modification in Arabidopsis thaliana. We furthermore tested the distribution of the heterochromatic histone mark H3K9me2, which is established, to a large extent, by the H3K9 methyltransferase KRYPTONITE, and occupies chromatin regions generally not targeted by PRC2. We report that effector-induced PCD caused major changes in the distribution of both repressive epigenetic modifications and that both modifications have a regulatory role and impact on the onset of PCD during pathogen infection. Our work highlights that the transition to pathogen-induced PCD is epigenetically controlled, revealing striking similarities to developmental PCD.

Nevertheless, their function in seed development remains largely unknown. Here we show that the imprinted Arabidopsis thaliana MADS-box TF PHERES1 (PHE1) is a master regulator of paternally expressed imprinted genes, as well as of non-imprinted key regulators of endosperm development. PHE1 binding sites show distinct epigenetic modifications on maternal and paternal alleles, correlating with parental-specific transcriptional activity. Importantly, we show that the CArG-box-like DNA-binding motifs bound by PHE1 have been distributed by RC/Helitron transposable elements. Our data provide an example of molecular domestication of these elements, which by distributing PHE1 binding sites throughout the genome, have facilitated the recruitment of crucial endosperm regulators into a single transcriptional network.

PRJNA590034	SUMOylation on plant chromatin controls transcription switches between development and heat response [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"SUMOylation, a post-translational protein modification, is dramatically upregulated and critically involved in heat stress response conservatively among species. Previous studies in Arabidopsis indicated that numerous chromatin associated proteins are SUMOylation substrates and most of heat-enhancing SUMOylation reactions occur in nucleus. However, the global functional connection between gene expression regulation and SUMOylation on chromatin is completely unknown in plant cells. Here we show a genome-wide relationship of chromatin-associated SUMOylation and transcription switches under room temperature, heat stress, and recovering conditions in Arabidopsis. The SUMO-associated chromatin sites, characterized via whole-genome ChIP-seq assays, are generally correlated with active chromatin markers. In response to heat stress, we found chromatin-associated SUMO signals increased at promoter-transcriptional start site regions and decreased in the gene bodies. Further RNA-seq analysis supported the role of chromatin-associated SUMOylation in activation of transcription during rapid responses to high temperature. Changing of SUMO signals on chromatin is correlated with upregulation of heat-responsive genes and downregulation of growth-related genes. Disruption of the SUMO ligase gene SIZ1 abolishes SUMO signals on chromatin and attenuates the rapid transcriptional responses to heat stress. Interestingly, the SUMO signal peaks are enriched in DNA elements recognized by distinguished groups of transcription factors under different temperature conditions. Collectively, our data provide evidence that SUMOylation on chromatin regulates transcription switches during development and heat stress response, improving our understanding on the precise roles of SUMOylation in plant cells.

Many characterized mutations impair environmental flowering responses, however downstream developmental processes have been more refractory to mutagenesis. We constructed a quintuple mutant in which several environmental pathways are impaired and showed that its flowering responses to changes in photoperiod and ambient temperature are almost abolished. Analysis of the quintuple mutant by RNA-seq showed that expression of gibberellin biosynthetic genes and transcription factors that contribute to the age pathway correlate with flowering. Mutagenesis of the quintuple mutant recovered two late-flowering mutants, quintuple ems 1 (qem1) and qem2. The causal genes were identified by isogenic mapping and transgenic complementation. The qem1 mutation was an allele of ga20ox2, confirming the importance of gibberellin for flowering in the absence of environmental responses. By contrast, qem2 is in CHROMATIN REMODELING 4 (CHR4), which was not previously genetically implicated in floral induction. Using co-immunoprecipitation, RNA-seq and ChIP-seq, we show that CHR4 interacts with transcription factors involved in floral meristem identity and affects expression of key floral regulators. We conclude that CHR4 plays important roles in the inflorescence meristem to promote floral identity.

PRJNA556985	Transcriptome analysis of cold responsive gene expression related to CBF2 loss of function in Arabidopsis thaliana	We examined the consequences of a naturally occurring loss of function (LOF) mutation in Arabidopsis thaliana, in an Italian allele of the gene that encodes the transcription factor CBF2, which underlies a major freezing tolerance locus. We used four lines with a Swedish genetic background, each containing a LOF CBF2 allele. Two lines had introgression segments containing the Italian CBF2 allele, and two contained deletions created using CRISPR-Cas9. We used a growth chamber experiment to quantify freezing tolerance and gene expression both before and after cold acclimation. Less...	
PRJNA578602	High-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq) analysis the effect of low concentration of SA (LCSA) application on methyl jasmonate (MeJA)-induced leaf senescence	Here, the effect of low concentration of SA (LCSA) application on MeJA-induced leaf senescence was assessed by high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq). The results showed that LCSA did not have significant dominant effects on the genetic regulatory pathways of basal metabolism like nitrogen metabolism, photosynthesis and glycolysis. Interestingly, using interaction network analysis of the differentially expressed genes (DEGs) that exclusively induced by MeJA together with LCSA, several clusters including autophagy-related (ATG) network were identified. RT-qPCR confirmed that the expression of most of the determined ATG genes were upregulated by LCSA. In contrast to wild type (Col-0), LCSA cannot alleviate the leaf yellowing phenotype in autophagy defective mutants (atg5-1 and atg7-2) upon MeJA treatment. Collectively, our work revealed up-regulation of autophagy by LCSA as a key regulator to alleviate MeJA-induced leaf senescence. Less...	
PRJNA563066	Local changes in chromatin accessibility and transcriptional networks underlying the nitrate response in Arabidopsis roots	Transcriptional regulation, determined by chromatin structure and regulatory elements interacting at promoter regions, is a key step in plant responses to environmental cues. Nitrate (NO3-) is a nutrient signal that regulates the expression of hundreds of genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Here we integrate mRNA-seq, genome-wide RNA polymerase II (RNPII), ChIP-Seq and DNase-seq data sets to establish the relationship between RNPII occupancy and chromatin accessibility in response to NO3- treatments in Arabidopsis root organs. Genomic footprinting allowed us to identify in vivo regulatory elements controlling gene expression in response to NO3- treatments. NO3--modulated TF footprints are important for a rapid increase in RNPII occupancy and transcript accumulation over time. We mapped key TF regulatory interactions and functionally validated the role of NAP, a NAC-domain containing TF, as a new regulatory factor in NO3- transport. Our strategy provides a comprehensive view of transcriptional networks in response to a nutrient signal in Arabidopsis roots. Less...

PRJNA576277	Chromosome structure at metabolic gene clusters	Functionally related genes that determine multi-step processes in plants, such as genes for primary metabolic pathways or developmental processes, are typically dispersed throughout the genome. Biosynthetic gene clusters that encode pathways for specialised metabolites are an exception to this rule and resemble gene order in bacteria. We have recently shown that such biosynthetic gene cluster in diverse species have characteristic epigenetic signatures. Here, we investigate how chromosome topology relates to transcriptional activity of clustered metabolic pathway genes using different organ specific chromosome conformation capture techniques and high-resolution microscopy. Our analyses reveal that silenced clusters associate with heterochromatic chromosomal domains towards the periphery of the nucleus, while transcriptionally active clusters re-locate away from the nuclear periphery. We further show that the biosynthetic gene clusters are embedded in local hot-spots of three-dimensional contacts. These local topological conformations differ between active and silenced clusters. Our analyses provide a high-resolution view of the large-scale 3D chromosomal reconfigurations that accompany transcriptional changes at co-ordinately regulated gene groups in a compact eukaryotic genome. We speculate that selective global and local chromosomal re-organisation is crucial for effective transcriptional control of co-localised and functionally related genes. Less...

Col and the NR-null mutant were grown for 7 days using 2.5 mM ammonium as the sole nitrogen source. The plants were treated with 10 mM nitrate and 2.5 mM ammonium for the first 24 hours so that they would accumulate nitrate. The plants were then transferred to nitrogen-free medium and grown for 5 days.

Using their shoots and roots, RNA sequencing was performed. Less...	
PRJEB15579	Direct RNA Sequencing of polyadenylated RNA & high-depth Illumina strand-specific, short read RNA-seq of a stably RNAi-silenced nuclear 5’-3’ exonuclease XRN3 mutant line in Arabidopsis thaliana	In Arabidopsis thaliana two nuclear 5'-3' exonucleases, XRN2 & 3, are involved in the degradation and processing of several classes of nuclear RNAs and in transcription termination of RNA polymerase II. The role of XRN3 in Pol II transcription termination is investigated by combining two different types of RNA-seq data for Col-0 background WT and xrn3-8 mutant A. thaliana seedlings. The data for the experiment comprises single molecule Direct RNA Sequencing of unamplified RNA (3x WT, 4x xrn3-8 mutant) and high-depth Illumina strand-specific short read sequencing of PCR amplified ribosomal-RNA depleted RNA (Illumina TruSeq stranded ribozero Plant kit, 3x WT, 3x xrm3-8 mutant). In the xrn3 mutant, these data reveal a widespread accumulation of non-coding intergenic transcripts (xrn3-associated transcripts - XATs) generated by Pol II read-through transcription that are usually polyadenylated and lack the 5' cap structure. This data highlights the important role of exoribonucleases in the torpedo mechanism of Pol II transcription termination and show that a global disturbance in this process significantly impacts both gene expression and transcriptome integrity.

PRJEB27944	Arabidopsis requires PECTINACETYLESTERASE 9 for constitutive but not induced defenses against Myzus persicae aphids	The plant cell wall plays an important role in constitutive and induced defenses against pathogens and herbivorous insects. Current understanding is largely based on the degree of pectin methylesterification. Little is, however, known about pectin esterification. Here, the involvement of the non-redundant PECTINACETYLESTERASE 9 (PAE9) in aphid resistance is studied in Arabidopsis. Aphids are piercing-sucking insects that invade their host via the cell wall and induce the jasmonic acid (JA) and salicylic acid pathways. On PAE9 loss-of-function mutants, aphids established phloem feeding earlier than on the wild type. Surprisingly, this did not lead to eventual differences in aphid population size. Whole-genome transcriptomic analyses revealed that pae9 mutants had a constitutive lower expression of biotic stress-related genes involved in the indole phytoalexin pathway, but that these mutants recovered within 8 h after aphid infestation. Phytohormone quantification showed that JA levels were indeed lower, but increased to wild-type level within 4 to 8 h of aphid infestation. Less...

PRJEB29194	Transposition favors the generation of large effect mutations that may facilitate rapid adaption	Transposable elements (TEs) are mobile parasitic sequences that have been repeatedly coopted during evolution to generate new functions and rewire gene regulatory networks. Yet, the contribution of active TEs to the creation of heritable mutations remains unknown. Using TE accumulation lines in Arabidopsis thaliana we show that once initiated, transposition produces an exponential spread of TE copies, which rapidly leads to high mutation rates. Most insertions occur near or within genes and targets differ between TE families. We uncover an essential role of the histone variant H2A.Z in the preferential integration of Ty1/copia retrotransposons within environmentally responsive genes and away from essential genes. Furthermore, we show that epigenetic silencing of new Ty1/copia copies can affect their impact on major fitness-related traits, including flowering time. Our findings demonstrate that TEs are potent episodic (epi)mutagens that, thanks to marked chromatin tropisms, limit the mutation load and increase the potential for rapid adaptation. Less...

PRJEB34520	Arabidopsis thaliana mutants RNACapSeq studyIsolation and sequencing of the mRNAs/cDNAs from wild-type and selected mutant Arabidopsis lines for studying the roles of corresponding genes in ETI early response gene regulations.	Effector-triggered immunity (ETI) results in changes in gene transcript abundance. Previously, Jones Laboratory identified a list of ETI-specific early response genes (ERGs) at their transcript level through a time-course genome-wide RNAseq (Sohn et al. 2014 PLOS Genetics). We ask how the ERGs are regulated in ETI-specific manner, and what regulatory elements could be involved. Based on the literature, we selected several mutants (eds1-2[Col-0], rrs1-3 rrs1b-1, sard1 cbp60g, myc2 myc3 myc4, tpr1 tpl tpr4, pad4 ein2 dde2 sid2, sid2) to test the ERGs expressions upon ETI induction through Pf0-1 carrying AvrRps4 or AvrRpt2 (ETI plus PAMP-triggered immunity [PTI]). The control plants are wild-type (WT) Col-0. The control treatments are untreated Col-0, mock treatment (10mM MgCl2) on all genotypes, and PTI alone (infiltration of Pf0-1 carrying AvrRps4 KRVY135-138AAAA mutant). We collected 2 leaves or leaf discs from each individual plant, and we collected 6 leaves or leaf discs from each genotype and each treatment at 4 hours post-infiltration. The OD600 of each Pf0-1 strains for infiltration is 0.2 in 10MgCl2. All plants were grown in a short-day controlled light chamber (JIC B5102). Every treatment and genotype have three biological replicates (3 batches of samples are collected on independent dates, and each batch contains one full set of samples from the WT and all selected mutants with all treatments). Total RNAs are isolated with TriReagent (Sigma T9424) and Zymo RNA Clean and Concentrator kit. mRNAs are isolated with Dynabeads™ Oligo(dT)25 (ThermoFisher Scientific 61002) by purifying with the beads twice. Total RNAs and mRNAs quality and purity were tested through Bioanalyzer with Agilent RNA 6000 Nano and Pico kit, respectively. The first strands of cDNAs are synthesized with random decamers (Invitrogen AM5722G) and SuperScript™ III Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen 18080044 ). The second strands of cDNAs are followed the same protocol reported in the literature (Rallapalli et al 2014 BMC Genomics). cDNA libraries are generated through Illumina Nextera kit with 100pg input for each sample. Instead of genome-wide sequencing, we designed 120nt RNA bait libraries (http://www.mycroarray.com) to enrich the sequences from 52 genes of interests (ERGs and control genes) (capture sequencing or CapSeq). Each library is barcoded with customer designed dual indexes (P5 and P7) with 9nt-index-nucleotide inserts. Before the CapSeq, we mixed equal weight (ng) of each RNAseq libraries with different indexes, because they have very similar size distribution on the Bioanalyzer. We spiked in 4 Col-0 genomic DNA (gDNA) libraries generated with Nextera kit as CapSeq control. The quantity of each gDNA library is 10-fold less than each cDNA library. Following the Standalone protocol from NextSeq, we used 1.8pM final library as the input for sequencing. We used NextSeq® 500/550 High Output Kit v2 (75 cycles) (FC-404-2005) to perform the single-end (SE) and dual-index RNAseq on the NextSeq 500 machin located in JIC. Less...	
PRJEB35324	Arabidopsis thaliana Cybrids - RNA SequencingReciprocal cybrids reveal how organellar genomes affect plant phenotypes	Assessing the impact of variation in chloroplast and mitochondrial DNA (collectively termed the plasmotype) on plant phenotypes is challenging due to the difficulty in separating their effect from nuclear derived variation (the nucleotype). Haploid inducer lines can be used as efficient plasmotype donors to generate new plasmotype-nucleotype combinations (cybrids). We generated a panel comprising all possible cybrids of seven Arabidopsis thaliana accessions and extensively phenotyped these lines for 1859 phenotypes under stable and fluctuating conditions. We show that natural variation in the plasmotype results in additive as well as epistatic effects across all phenotypic categories. Plasmotypes which induce more additive phenotypic changes also cause more significant epistatic effects, suggesting a possible common basis for both additive and epistatic effects. On average epistatic interactions explained twice as much of the variance in phenotypes as additive plasmotype effects. The impact of plasmotypic variation was also more pronounced under fluctuating and stressful environmental conditions. Thus, the phenotypic impact of variation in plasmotypes is the outcome of multilevel Nucleotype x Plasmotype x Environment interactions and, as such, the plasmotype is likely to serve as a reservoir of variation which is predominantly exposed under certain conditions.  The production of cybrids using haploid inducers is a quick and precise method for assessing the phenotypic effects of natural variation in organellar genomes. It will facilitate efficient screening of unique nucleotype-plasmotype combinations to both improve our understanding of natural variation in nucleotype-plasmotype interactions and identify favourable combinations to improve plant performance.

PRJNA573716	The receptor-like kinase NIK1 targets FLS2/BAK1 immune complex and inversely modulates antiviral and antibacterial immunity	Among the factors that limit plant growth and productivities, pathogens cause major crop yield losses worldwide and represent serious threats to food security. Plants deploy various immune receptors to recognize pathogens and defend themselves. The first class of immune receptors is cell-surface associated pattern recognition receptors (PRRs), which are often represented by receptor-like kinases (RLKs) and receptor-like proteins (RLPs). PRRs recognize conserved structural motifs present in microbes, known as microbe- or pathogen-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs/PAMPs). Perception of PAMPs by PRRs activates PAMP-triggered immunity (PTI), which inhibits a broad spectrum of potential pathogens, including bacteria, viruses, fungi, and oomycetes. An antiviral defence mechanism uncovered recently, relies on host translation suppression mediated by a transmembrane immune receptor, NUCLEAR SHUTTLE PROTEIN-INTERACTING KINASE 1 (NIK1). NIK1 was first identified as virulence targets of the begomovirus nuclear shuttle proteins (NSPs). Loss of NIK1 function increases susceptibility to viral infection, whereas enhanced accumulation of NIK1 confers tolerance to begomovirus. The receptor-like kinase NIK1, was previously shown to positively regulate plant antiviral immunity, acts as an important negative regulator of antibacterial immunity. Plants that are nik1 null exhibit dwarfed morphology, enhanced disease resistance to the bacteria Pseudomonas syringae and enhanced bacterial flagellin–triggered PTI responses, which were restored by reintroduction of NIK1. In addition, NIK1 negatively regulates the formation of the FLS2/BAK1 complex and flg22-mediated responses. The proposed underlying mechanism for NIK1-mediated inverse modulation of antiviral and antibacterial immunity may allow bacteria and viruses to activate host immune responses against each other.

PRJNA541053	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	Histones are highly basic proteins involved in packaging DNA into chromatin, and histone modifications are fundamental in epigenetic regulation in eukaryotes. Among the numerous chromatin modifiers identified in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), MORF RELATED GENE 1 (MRG1) and MRG2 have redundant functions in reading histone H3 lysine 36 trimethylation (H3K36me3). Here, we show that MRG2 binds histone chaperones belonging to the NUCLEOSOME ASSEMPLY PROTEIN 1 (NAP1) family, including NAP1-RELATED PROTEIN 1 (NRP1) and NRP2. Characterization of the loss-of-function mutants mrg1 mrg2, nrp1 nrp2 and mrg1 mrg2 nrp1 nrp2 revealed that MRG1/MRG2 and NRP1/NRP2 regulate flowering time through fine-tuning transcription of floral genes by distinct molecular mechanisms. In particular, the physical interaction between NRP1/NRP2 and MRG1/MRG2 inhibited the binding of MRG1/MRG2 to the transcription factor CONSTANS (CO), leading to a transcriptional repression of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) through impeded H4K5 acetylation (H4K5ac) within the FT chromatin. In contrast, NRP1/2 and MRG1/MRG2 act together, likely in a multiprotein complex manner, in promoting transcription of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) via increase of both H4K5ac and H3K9ac in the FLC chromatin. Because the expression pattern of FLC represents the major category of differentially expressed genes identified by our genome-wide RNA-seq analysis in the mrg1 mrg2, nrp1 nrp2 and mrg1 mrg2 nrp1 nrp2 mutants, it is reasonable to speculate that the NRP1/2-MRG1/MRG2 complex may be involved in transcriptional activation of genes beyond FLC and flowering time control.

This effort generated a collection of eighteen mutants defective in various splicing-related proteins, many of which have not yet been characterized or recovered in any prior genetic screen in plants. The factors are predicted to act at different steps of the spliceosomal cycle, snRNP biogenesis pathway, transcription, and mRNA transport. Eleven of the mutants have been described in recent publications. Here we reveal the identity of the final seven mutants retrieved in the screen. We present new RNA-sequencing data and analyses of differential gene expression and alternative splicing patterns in a new mutant that is defective in CAP BINDING PROTEIN 80 (CBP80) and in several previously published mutants for which such information was not yet available. We discuss the cumulative findings and their implications for the regulation of pre-mRNA splicing efficiency and alternative splicing in plants.

PRJNA497671	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana, chromatin positioning at the nuclear periphery	The nuclear envelope not only serves as a physical barrier separating nuclear content from the cytoplasm but also plays critical roles in modulating the three-dimensional organization of genomic DNA. For both plants and animals, the nuclear periphery (NP) is a functional compartment enriched for heterochromatin. To date, how plants manage to selectively tether chromatin at the NP is unclear. By conducting dual-color in situ hybridization experiments on 2C nuclei, we show that in Arabidopsis thaliana, specific chromatin positioning at the NP requires plant lamin-like proteins CROWDED NUCLEI 1 (CRWN1) and CRWN4. In metazoans, the epigenetic mark, histone H3 lysine 9 methylation (H3K9me), is required for the anchoring of targeted chromatin at the NP; however, the loss of H3K9me has no effect in this regard in Arabidopsis. Instead, DNA methylation in CHG and CHH contexts turn out to be required for this process. With chromosome painting and Hi-C analyses, we show global attenuation of spatial chromatin compartmentalization and chromatin positioning patterns at the NP in both the crwn1 and crwn4 mutants. Furthermore, CRWN1 directly interacts with chromatin domains localized at the NP, which mainly contains transposable elements and silenced genes. In summary, we conclude that CRWN1 is a key component of the lamina-chromatin network in plants. It is functionally equivalent to animal lamins, playing critical roles in modulating patterns of chromatin positioning at the NP. This is a collection of raw sequencing data associated with: Hu B, Wang N, Bi X, Karaaslan ES, Weber AL, Zhu W, Berendzen KW, Liu C.

PRJNA498324	A cis-carotene derived cleavage product acts downstream of deetiolated 1 to control protochlorophyllide oxidoreductase and prolamellar body formation	Cleavage products of cis-carotenes are reported to regulate nuclear gene expression, carotenoid homeostasis and leaf development in plants. The substrate(s), where and when they accumulate, as well as their physiological and regulatory mechanism remain unknown. The loss-in-function of the carotenoid isomerase (crtiso) mutants perturb prolamellar body (PLB) formation in etioplasts and induce yellow virescent phenotypes in leaves. Here we demonstrate how growing crtiso mutant plants under an extended period of darkness (shorter day length) can trigger the generation of cis-carotenes and perturb plastid development. By use of a forward genetics screen we show how an epistatic interaction between the ζ-carotene isomerase (ziso-155) and Arabidopsis crtiso (ccr2) mutants blocked the biosynthesis of specific cis-carotene substrates, thereby restoring PLB formation in cotyledon etioplasts and chloroplast development in leaves. Chemical inhibition of carotenoid cleavage dioxygenase activity restored PLB formation in ccr2 etioplasts during skotomorphogenesis and chloroplast development in cotyledons following de-etiolation, providing a function for a novel cis-carotene-derived signaling metabolite. The cis-carotene cleavage product acted downstream of a repressor of photomorphogenesis, DET1, to post-transcriptionally regulate PROTOCHLOROPHYLLIDE OXIDOREDUCTASE (POR), PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR3 (PIF3) and ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL5 (HY5) protein levels, the latter of which controls photosynthesis associated nuclear gene expression. We demonstrate that ccr2 and a det1-154 mutant block PLB formation in etioplasts by POR independent and dependent processes respectively, as a ccr2 det1-154 double mutant develops a PLB and green leaves following de-etiolation. We describe a model whereby CRTISO and DET1 control the generation of an intracellular cis-carotene derived cleavage product that fine-tunes plastid development during extended periods of darkness.

However, in colonized Arabidopsis roots, fungal nutrient transporter genes GintPT, GintAMT2, GintMST2 and GintMST4, essential for AM symbiosis, were not activated. RNA-seq transcriptome analysis pointed to activation of costly defenses in colonized Arabidopsis roots. Moreover, Rhizophagus colonization caused a 50% reduction in shoot biomass, but also led to enhanced systemic immunity against Botrytis cinerea.• This suggests that early signaling between AM fungi and Arabidopsis is not completely impaired and that incompatibility appears at later interaction stages. Moreover, Rhizophagus-mediated defenses coincide with reduced Arabidopsis growth, but also with systemic disease resistance, highlighting the multifunctional role of AM fungi in host and non-host interactions.

PRJNA494862	Extracellular ATP-induced defense transcriptome in Arabidopsis thaliana	Adenosine 5’-triphosphate (ATP) is not only an essential metabolite of cellular biochemistry, but also acts as a signal in the extracellular milieu. In Arabidopsis thaliana, extracellular ATP is monitored by the lectin receptor kinase P2K1, also known as DORN1. Recent studies have revealed that extracellular ATP acts as a damage associated molecular pattern in plants and its signaling through P2K1 is important for mounting an effective defense response against various pathogenic microorganisms. Biotrophic and necrotrophic pathogens attack plants using different strategies, for which plants respond accordingly with salicylate-based and jasmonate/ethylene-based defensive signaling, respectively. Defense mediated by P2K1 is effective against pathogens of both lifestyles, raising the question of the level of interplay between extracellular ATP signaling and that of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate. To address this idea, we analyzed ATP-induced transcriptomes in wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings and mutant seedlings defective in essential components in the signaling pathways of jasmonate, ethylene, and salicylate, classic defense hormones, as well as a mutant and a overexpression line of the P2K1 receptor.

Here we reported the important role of BAM3 in anther development. We demonstrated that in the anther, bam3-2 single mutant exhibited delayed tapetal degradation and a more extensively covered surface through cell biological analyses. Further transcriptomic studies revealed that 813 genes significantly expressed at the RNA level in the bam3-2 mutant compared with wild-type, which were enriched in pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, lipid transfer, and proteolysis. Moreover, an intersection analysis of significantly regulated genes in bam3-2, DN-CLE19 and ams revealed BAM3, CLE19 and AMS commonly affected the expression level of many genes, especially genes invovled in pollen development such as CYP703A2、LAP6、TKPR2、CYP703B1、MS2、WBC27、MEE48、QRT3、LAP5、DRL1 and MYB103.

PRJNA411947	Arabidopsis thaliana isolate:Columbia (thale cress)RNA-seq analysis reveals organ-specific cold response in Arabidopsis thaliana	Cold stress response is extensively studied process in plants. However most studies explore only limited set of organs and developmental stages (leaves or seedlings). In order to gain insight into organ-specific strategies of cold stress response we studied expression changes that follow exposure to cold (+4ºC) in different aerial parts of plant: cotyledons, hypocotyl, leaves, young flowers, mature flowers and seeds using RNA-seq. It showed that gene expression is highly organ-specific. The results on differential expression in leaves are congruent with current knowledge on stress response pathways, in particular, the role of CBF genes. In other organs, both essence and dynamics of gene expression changes are different. We show the involvement of genes that are confined to narrow expression patterns in non-stress conditions into stress response. In particular, the genes that control cell wall modification in pollen, are activated in leaves. In seeds, predominant pattern is the change of lipid metabolism. We found that stress response is highly organ-specific and highlighted the processes that are involved in this process in each type of organs. Less...	
PRJNA504740	Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia-0 (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia-0 Raw sequence reads	Quorum sensing is a common phenomenon in bacteria to control bacterial behaviour at the population level.

However, the direct interaction of quorum sensing signals with host biological processes is poorly understood.

PRJNA207397	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Maternal siRNAs mediate spatial and temporal regulation of gene expression and seed development in Arabidopsis	"In Arabidopsis seed development involves maternal small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) that induce RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) through the NRPD1 pathway. To investigate their biological functions we characterized siRNAs in the endosperm and seed coat that were separated by laser capture microdissection (LCM) in reciprocal genetic crosses with an nrpd1 mutant. We also monitored the spatio-temporal activity of the NRPD1 pathway on seed development using AGO4:GFP::AGO4 (promoter:GFP::protein) reporter and promoter:GUS sensors of siRNA-mediated silencing. From these approaches we identified four distinct groups of siRNA loci that were dependent on or independent of the maternal NRPD1 allele in the endosperm or seed coat. A group of maternally expressed NRPD1-siRNA loci targets endosperm-preferred genes, including those encoding AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) transcription factors. Using the sensor AGL40:GUS and AGL91:GUS constructs we demonstrate that spatial and temporal expression patterns of these genes in the endosperm were regulated by the NRPD1-mediated pathway irrespective of complete silencing (AGL91) or incomplete silencing (AGL40) of these target genes. Modified expression of these siRNA-targeted genes affects seed size and we propose that the corresponding maternal siRNAs could account for parent-of-origin effects on the endosperm in interploidy and hybrid crosses. These analyses reconcile previous studies on siRNAs and imprinted gene expression during seed development.
Overall design: 1. Examination of small RNAs in embryo, endosperm and seed coat of Arabidopsis seeds. 2. Examiniation of small RNAs in reciprocal crosses between wild type and nrpd1a mutant as well as rdr2 mutant. 7 crosses were made including 3 self pollination of parent strains. Less..."

We find that trait-associated variation localizes within DHSs, and that extensive TF occupancy within protein-coding exons has shaped A. thaliana codon usage. Analysis of >700,000 TF footprints disclosed an extensive cis-regulatory lexicon, and enabled construction of large-scale TF cross-regulatory networks. Although the cis- and trans-regulatory repertoire is markedly distinct from mammals, the architecture of A. thaliana TF networks is strikingly similar to those of human. Analysis of the DHS landscape and TF network dynamics during heat shock and photomorphogenesis revealed thousands of conditionally-sensitive elements and enabled mapping of key regulatory circuits. Our results provide an extensive resource for understanding and enabling diverse aspects of A. thaliana biology.

Here we generate a cell type specific transcriptome of an adult stem-cell lineage in the Arabidopsis leaf using RNA sequencing and microarrays. RNA profiles of stomatal entry, commitment, and differentiating cells, as well as of mature stomata and the entire aerial epidermis give a comprehensive view of the developmental progression.
Overall design: To obtain pure cell populations corresponding to different stomatal lineage cell types we used Fluorescent Activated Cell Sorting (FACS) in combination with markers of early (SPCHp::SPCH-YFP, SSY), middle (MUTEp::nucGFP, MG), and late (FAMAp::GFP-FAMA, FGF) precursor stages, as well of mature stomata (enhancer trap E1728::GFP, E1728G) and a marker of the entire epidermis (ML1p::YFP-RCI2A, ML1Y).

PRJNA275437	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Hybrid Mimics and Hybrid Vigor in Arabidopsis (F4 data)	"F1 hybrids can outperform their parents in yield and vegetative biomass, features of hybrid vigor which form the basis of the hybrid seed industry.  The yield advantage of the F1 is lost in the F2 and subsequent generations.  In Arabidopsis, from F2 plants which have a F1 –like phenotype, we have by recurrent selection produced pure breeding F5/F6 lines “Hybrid Mimics”, in which the characteristics of the F1 Hybrid are stabilized.  These Hybrid Mimic lines, like the F1 Hybrid, have larger leaves than the parent plant, the leaves having increased photosynthetic cell numbers, and in some lines increased size of cells, suggesting an increased supply of photosynthate.  A comparison of the differentially expressed genes in the F1 Hybrid with those of eight Hybrid Mimic lines has identified metabolic pathways altered in both; these pathways include down regulation of defense response pathways and altered abiotic response pathways.  F6 Hybrid Mimic lines are mostly homozygous at each locus in the genome yet retain the large F1-like phenotype.  Many alleles in the F6 plants, when they are homozygous, have expression levels different to the level in the parent.  We consider this altered expression to be a consequence of trans-regulation of genes from one parent by genes from the other parent.  Transregulation could also arise from epigenetic modifications in the F1.  The pure breeding Hybrid Mimics have been valuable in probing the mechanisms of hybrid vigor and may also prove to be useful hybrid vigor equivalents in agriculture.
Overall design: Plant Materials: Seeds were sterilized and sown onto plates containing MSN medium (MS salts supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose, pH7 with KOH, 0.6% wt/vol Noble agar).  After 2 days at 4°C, the plates were transferred to a growth room with conditions of 22 °C/18 °C (day/night) and 16h light/8h dark cycle under Philips Cool Daylight TLD 58W/840 fluorescent tubes providing a photosynthetic photon flux density of 130 - 150μmol photons m-2·s-1 as measured using a quantum meter (Model MQ-200 calibrated for electric light source, Apogee).  At 18 days after sowing (DAS), the plants were transferred to soil and grown to the reproductive stage in a growth room with controlled light conditions (OSRAM L 36W/865 LumLux Daylight, 130 - 150μmol photons m-2·s-1).  To minimize the edge effects, the positioning of both plates and trays on the shelves was rotated every two days.  All the plants were grown under the condition described above unless specified.
Plant sample preparation and RNA extraction:  For the transcriptomes of 15 DAS plants, the aerial tissues of 15 day seedlings were sampled.  For the transcriptomes of plants at 28 DAS, the four largest leaves of 28 day plants from the parental lines (C24, Ler), the reciprocal Hybrids and eight F4 Hybrid Mimic lines were harvested.  Each sample comprised a pool of five plants.  Two biological replicates of each sample were sequenced.  Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy MiniKitTM following the product instructions.  To eliminate variation in experimental conditions in different positions in the growth room, nine F4 plant lines were divided into two batches to ensure plants were grown on the same shelves in each experiment.   Parental lines C24 and Ler and the F1 Hybrid from which the F4 lines derived from were grown under the same conditions in each experiment as controls.  The first batch including samples C24 (RepA and RepB), Ler (RepA and RepB), C24 x Ler F1, F4-L1-1, F4-L1-2, F4-L2-1, F4-L2-2 and F4-S-1 were grown under the condition describe above, we also sampled the five smallest C24 seedlings and five smallest Ler seedlings among the population (n = 50); the mRNA sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).  The second batch including C24 (RepC and RepD), Ler (RepC and RepD), Ler x C24 F1 Hybrid, F4-L3-1, F4-L3-2, F4-L4-1 and F4-L4-2 were grown in the same light intensity as above but under different light tubes (SYLVANIA PREMIUM extra FL36W/865 Super Daylight deluxe light tube).

In plants, loss of different PcGs display both common and unique phenotypic defects, yet little is known about how these are established. Here, based on quantitative comparison of epigenomics data from mutants of key PcG components in Arabidopsis seedlings, we found that the PcG partners of CURLY LEAF (CLF), one of the major plant H3K27 trimethyltransferases, determines its selectivity in repressing gene loci involved in distinct developmental programs. The non-redundant role of CLF in determining flower development is specifically associated with HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN1 (LHP1). This context dependent effect of CLF corresponds well with tissue-biased target gene expression, and importantly, to differential co-occupancy of transcription factors, such as MADS box and B3-domain transcription factors. These results provide valuable insight as to the dynamic interplay between different PcGs and their collaborative control of plant development.

PRJNA316129	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Cytosolic acetyl-CoA promotes histone acetylation predominantly at H3K27 in Arabidopsis	"Acetyl-Coenzyme A (acetyl-CoA) is a central metabolite and the acetyl source for protein acetylation, particularly histone acetylation that promotes gene expression. However, the effect of acetyl-CoA levels on histone acetylation status in plants remains unknown. Here, we show that malfunctioned cytosolic acetyl-CoA carboxylase1 (ACC1) in Arabidopsis leads to elevated levels of acetyl-CoA and promotes histone hyperacetylation predominantly at lysine 27 of histone H3 (H3K27). The increase of H3K27 acetylation (H3K27ac) is dependent on ATP-citrate lyase which cleaves citrate to acetyl-CoA in the cytoplasm, and requires histone acetyltransferase GCN5. A comprehensive analysis of the transcriptome and metabolome in combination with the genome-wide H3K27ac profiles of acc1 mutants, demonstrate the dynamic changes of H3K27ac, gene transcripts and metabolites occurring in the cell by the increased levels of acetyl-CoA. This study suggests that H3K27ac is an important link between cytosolic acetyl-CoA level and gene expression in response to the dynamic metabolic environments in plants.

PRJNA317179	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Differential regulation of meristem size, morphology and organization by the ERECTA, CLAVATA and class III HD-ZIP pathways	"The shoot apical meristem (SAM) of angiosperm plants is a highly organized minute structure that gives rise to all above-ground organs. The SAM is divided into three different functional domains. The central zone (CZ) at the SAM tip harbors the self-renewing pluripotent stem cells and the organizing center, providing daughter cells that are continuously displaced into the interior rib zone (RZ) or to the surrounding peripheral zone (PZ), from which organ primordia are initiated. Despite the constant flow of cells from the CZ into the RZ or PZ, and cell recruitment for primordium formation, a stable balance is maintained between the distinct cell populations in the SAM. Here we combined an in depth phenotypic analysis with a comparative RNA-Seq approach to characterize meristems from selected combinations of clavata3 (clv3), jabba-1D (jba1D) and erecta (er) mutants. We demonstrate that CLV3 restricts meristem expansion along the apical basal axis, while class III HD-ZIP and ER pathways restrict meristem expansion laterally, but in distinct and possibly perpendicular orientations. Our k-means analysis reveals that clv3, jba-1D/+ and er lead to meristem enlargement by affecting different aspects of meristem function, e.g., that clv3 displays increase in stem cell population, whereas jba-1D/+ er exhibits increase in mitotic activity and in meristematic cell population. We demonstrate that thecombination of genetic and mRNA-Seq comparative approach provides a precise and sensitive method to identify cell type specific transcriptomes in a small structure such as the SAM.
Overall design: Ten samples enriched in shoot apical meristem tissue were analyzed, corresponding to 5 different genotypes (Col-0, clv3-2, jba-1D/+, jba-1D/+ er-20, and jba-1D/+ er-20 clv3-2) at two different developmental stages (8-day-old seedlings and 15-day-old seedlings).

In this study, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing is used to construct maps of DNA methylation with single base pair resolution in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings treated with each demethylating agent. We find that 5-azacytidine and zebularine-treated seedlings have nearly indistinguishable patterns of DNA methylation genome-wide and that 5-azacytidine, despite being more unstable in aqueous solution, has a slightly greater demethylating effect at higher concentrations across the genome. Transcriptome analyses revealed a substantial number of up-regulated genes and transposable element genes, particularly CACTA-like elements, demonstrating that chemical demethylating agents have a disproportionately large effect on loci that are silenced by DNA methylation.

It also plays a pivotal role in seed maturation and germination. Because of its importance, transcriptome changes in response to ABA have been profiled extensively by the plant community.  Very few ChIP-chip/seq of ABA-related TFs have been reported to date. To fill the knowledge gap about how ABA works at the transcriptional level, we carried out ChIP-seq on 21 TFs from 11 different families using both mock- and ABA-treated conditions. Analyses of the resulting 122 ChIP-seq datasets identified 326,698 TF binding events using a stringent statistical cutoff. Based on our data, a comprehensive regulatory network in Arabidopsis thaliana was constructed. We uncovered determinants of dynamic TF binding and defined a hierarchy among TFs to explain differential gene expression and pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics observed for the canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness, and demonstrate their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.

PRJNA338792	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)sRNA drives epigenetic changes in F1 hybrids	"Hybrid Arabidopsis plants undergo epigenetic reprogramming producing decreased levels of 24nt siRNAs and altered patterns of DNA methylation that can affect gene expression.  Driving the changes in methylation are the processes Trans Chromosomal Methylation (TCM) and Trans Chromosomal deMethylation (TCdM).  In TCM/TCdM the methylation state of one allele is altered to resemble the other allele.  These changes in DNA methylation and the associated changes in small RNA levels in the F1 hybrid can be maintained in subsequent generations and affect hundreds of regions in the F2 epigenome.  The inheritance of these altered epigenetic states varies in F2 individuals resulting in individuals with genetically identical loci displaying different epigenetic states and gene expression profiles.  At these regions the change in methylation is associated with the presence of small RNAs.  Loci without any sRNA activity can have altered methylation states, suggesting that a sRNA-independent mechanism may also contribute to the altered methylation state of the F1 and F2 generations.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana accessions C24 and Landsberg erecta (Ler,) were used as parental lines. Reciprocal C24 x Ler, hybrids were generated by hand pollination. For all libraries immature inflorescence was used.  sRNA and mRNA libraries were prepared from total RNA extracted using the Direct-zol RNA mini-prep kit.

PRJNA339285	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genomic architecture of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis	"Heterosis is most frequently manifested by the substantially increased vigorous growth of hybrids compared with their parents. Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 Arabidopsis hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include WUSCHEL, ARGOS, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative Arabidopsis hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions.

For this purpose, sulfur (S) metabolism and its crosstalk with nitrogen (N) and carbon (C) metabolism were analyzed in wildtype Arabidopsis and its photorespiratory bou-2 mutant with impaired glycine decarboxylase (GDC) activity. Foliar glycine and Ser contents were enhanced in the mutant at day and night. The high Ser levels in the mutant cannot be explained by transcript abundances of genes of the photorespiratory pathway or two alternative pathways of Ser biosynthesis. Despite enhanced foliar Ser, reduced GDC activity mediated a decline in sulfur flux into major sulfur pools in the mutant, as a result of deregulation of genes of sulfur reduction and assimilation. Still, foliar Cys and glutathione contents in the mutant were enhanced. The use of Cys for methionine and glucosinolates synthesis was reduced in the mutant. Reduced GDC activity in the mutant downregulated Calvin Cycle and nitrogen assimilation genes, upregulated key enzymes of glycolysis and the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) pathway and modified accumulation of sugars and TCA intermediates. Thus, photorespiratory Ser production can be replaced by other metabolic Ser sources, but this replacement deregulates the cross-talk between S, N, and C metabolism.

High density mapping of 5.8S rRNA precursors and mature 5.8S rRNA was performed using 3’ RACE-seq. 3’ RACE-seq is an IIlumina-based sequencing strategy designed to map 3’ extremities (Sikorska et al. 2017).

PRJNA385813	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)A protein complex regulates RNA processing of intronic heterochromatin-containing genes in Arabidopsis	"In several eukaryotic organisms, heterochromatin (HC) in the introns of genes can regulate RNA processing, including polyadenylation, but the mechanism underlying this regulation is poorly understood. By promoting distal polyadenylation, the bromo-adjacent homology (BAH) domain-containing and RNA recognition motif-containing protein ASI1 and the H3K9me2-binding protein EDM2 are required for the expression of functional full-length transcripts of intronic HC-containing genes in Arabidopsis. Here we report that ASI1 and EDM2 form a protein complex in vivo via a bridge protein, ASI1-Immunoprecipitated Protein 1 (AIPP1), which is another RNA recognition motif-containing protein. The complex also may contain the Pol II CTD phosphatase CPL2, the plant homeodomain-containing protein AIPP2, and another BAH domain protein, AIPP3. As is the case with dysfunction of ASI1 and EDM2, dysfunction of AIPP1 impedes the use of distal polyadenylation sites at tested intronic HC-containing genes, such as the histone demethylase gene IBM1, resulting in a lack of functional full-length transcripts. A mutation in AIPP1 causes silencing of the 35S-SUC2 transgene and genome-wide CHG hypermethylation at gene body regions, consistent with the lack of full-length functional IBM1 transcripts in the mutant. Interestingly, compared with asi1, edm2, and aipp1 mutations, mutations in CPL2, AIPP2, and AIPP3 cause the opposite effects on the expression of intronic HC-containing genes and other genes, suggesting that CPL2, AIPP2, and AIPP3 may form a distinct subcomplex. These results advance our understanding of the interplay between heterochromatic epigenetic modifications and RNA processing in higher eukaryotes.
Overall design: MethylC-Seq: 3 samples examined and each sample has two replicates, Col-0, aipp1-1, and aipp1-2; mRNA-Seq: 4 samples examined and each sample has two replicates, Col-0, aipp1-1, asi1-2 and edm2-4.

PRJNA384645	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)H3K27 tri-methyltransferases CLF and SWN redundantly buffer ABA-induced senescence	"The phytohormone abscisic acid (ABA) induces senescence and facilitates nutrient reuse, which are essential for increasing stress tolerance. Senescence controls plant aging and is closely associated with crop yield and quality. It is a complicated process finely tuned by multiple layers of control. A significant proportion of ABA-responsive genes and cis-elements are targeted by H3K27me3 modification that is mediated by Polycomb group proteins (PcGs); however, the interplay between the major epigenetic machinery and the central stress hormone is poorly understood. Both pathways influence the transcription of thousands of genes, and the dynamic and quantitative epigenomic and transcriptomic changes cannot be characterized with high confidence. This issue is further complicated by the redundant roles of PcG components. This article revealed an intriguing mechanism of the interplay between ABA and PcG in regulating plant senescence, based on the integration of genetic evidence and quantitative comparison of epigenomic data derived from a purpose-developed computational model. We observed that >30% of ABA-induced genes are up-regulated in a double mutant of H3K27me3 methyltransferases CLF and SWN; and the double mutant, but not single-gene mutants, is hyper-sensitive to ABA treatment. Importantly, ABA-triggered H3K27me3 reduction preferentially occurred in regions around senescence-associated genes (SAGs), which are redundantly repressed by CLF and SWN in normal conditions. Furthermore, we revealed that the presence of H3K27me3 surrounding SAGs does not block ABA-induced SAG expression, but rather limits the extent of the induction, thereby preventing an over-sensitive response within a dynamic environment. These findings may serve as a paradigm for the crosstalk between the rapid-effect of phytohormone and the long-term effect of epigenetic machinery in regulating plant environmental responses through modulations of the senescence process.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were grown on 1/2 Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium without sucrose (2% agar, PH 5.8) under LDs conditions. clf-50swn-1 is in the Ws background. For ABA treatment, 10-d old seedlings were transferred onto 1/2 MS medium containing 50 uM ABA or 100 uM ABA.

PRJNA390146	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)MAPK-triggered chromatin reprogramming by histone deacetylase in plant innate immunity	"Microbial-associated molecular patterns (MAMPs) activate several MAP Kinases (MAPKs), which are major regulators of the innate immune response in Arabidopsis that induce large-scale changes in gene expression. Here, we determined whether MAMP-triggered gene expression involves chromatin modifications at the chromosomal level. Our results show that histone acetylation and deacetylation are major regulators of MAMP-triggered gene expression and implicate the histone deacetylase HD2B in the reprogramming of defense gene expression and innate immunity. The MAPK MPK3 directly interacts with and phosphorylates HD2B, thereby regulating the intra-nuclear compartmentalization and function of the histone deacetylase. By studying a number of gene loci that undergo MAMP-dependent activation or repression, our data reveal a mechanistic model for how protein kinase signaling directly impacts chromatin reprogramming in plant defense.

PRJNA392252	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genomic architecture of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis	"Heterosis is most frequently manifested by the substantially increased vigorous growth of hybrids compared with their parents. Investigating genomic variations in natural populations is essential to understand the initial molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis in plants. Here, we characterized the genomic architecture associated with biomass heterosis in 200 Arabidopsis hybrids. The genome-wide heterozygosity of hybrids makes a limited contribution to biomass heterosis, and no locus shows an obvious overdominance effect in hybrids. However, the accumulation of significant genetic loci identified in genome wide association studies (GWAS) in hybrids strongly correlates with better-parent heterosis (BPH). Candidate genes for biomass BPH fall into diverse biological functions, including cellular, metabolic, and developmental processes and stimulus-responsive pathways. Important heterosis candidates include WUSCHEL, ARGOS, and some genes that encode key factors involved in cell cycle regulation. Interestingly, transcriptomic analyses in representative Arabidopsis hybrid combinations reveal that heterosis candidate genes are functionally enriched in stimulus-responsive pathways, including responses to biotic and abiotic stimuli and immune responses. In addition, stimulus-responsive genes are repressed to low-parent levels in hybrids with high BPH, whereas middle-parent expression patterns are exhibited in hybrids with no BPH. Our study reveals a genomic architecture for understanding the molecular mechanisms of biomass heterosis in Arabidopsis, in which the accumulation of the superior alleles of genes involved in metabolic and cellular processes improve the development and growth of hybrids, whereas the overall repressed expression of stimulus responsive genes prioritizes growth over responding to environmental stimuli in hybrids under normal conditions.

Here, we identify an H3K9me2 binding protein, Agenet domain (AGD)-containing protein 1 (AGDP1), in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our biochemical studies revealed that the AGDP1 can specifically recognize the H3K9me2 marks by the three pairs of tandem-AGDs. We determined the crystal structure of the AGD12 of Raphanus sativus AGDP1 in complex with an H3K9me2 peptide. In the complex, the histone peptide adopts a unique helical conformation. AGD12 employs a newly defined interacting interface to specifically recognize the H3K4me0 and H3K9me2 marks. In addition, we found that AGDP1 is required for transcriptional gene silencing, non-CG DNA methylation, and H3K9 dimethylation. Our ChIP-seq data showed that AGDP1 is enriched in TE regions and associated with the heterochromatin marks. Our findings suggest that, as a heterochromatin binding protein, AGDP1 links H3K9me2 to DNA methylation in heterochromatin regions.

PRJNA389675	The Nonstop decay and the RNA silencing systems operate cooperatively in plants	"Translation-dependent mRNA quality control systems protect the protein homeostasis of eukaryotic cells by eliminating aberrant transcripts and stimulating the decay of their protein products. Although these systems are intensively studied in animals, little is known about the translation-dependent quality control systems in plants. Here we characterize the mechanism of nonstop decay (NSD) system in Nicotiana benthamiana model plant. We show that plant NSD efficiently degrades nonstop mRNAs, which can be generated by premature polyadenylation, and stop codon-less transcripts, which can be produced by endonucleolytic cleavage. We demonstrate that in plants, like in animals, Pelota, Hbs1 and SKI2 proteins are required for NSD, supporting that NSD is an ancient and conserved eukaryotic quality control system. Relevantly, we found that NSD and RNA silencing systems cooperate in plants. Plant silencing predominantly represses target mRNAs through endonucleolytic cleavage in the coding region. The cleavage products are degraded by general decay systems or subjected to silencing amplification. The balance between decay and silencing amplification might be finely regulated by unknown mechanisms. Here we show that NSD is required for the elimination of 5’cleavage product when mi- or siRNA-guided silencing complex cleaves in the coding region. Thus NSD might regulate the frequency of silencing amplification.
Overall design: To verify if NSD is also involved in the degradation of 5’ cleavage products of endogenous miRNA targets, RNA-seq libraries (in triplicates) were prepared with random primers from ribo-depleted RNA samples, which were isolated from Pelota- and Control silenced N. benthamiana leaves (RNA-seq1 and RNA-seq2 experiments) and from wild type (Columbia) and pelota1 and hbs1 T-DNA mutant Arabidopsis thaliana leaves (Arabidopsis RNA-seq).

We first analyzed gene expression levels in the leaves before detachment (at time 0) from the three developmental states. Changes in gene expression could be grouped into six clusters. Many genes were upregulated or downregulated during leaf maturation. Next, we analyzed gene expression levels in the leaf explants from 9- and 15-d-old seedlings at 1 DAC compared with gene expression levels at time 0. By comparing up- or downregulated genes (1 DAC vs time 0) between leaves from 9- and 15-d-old seedlings, we found that many of the genes were particularly up- or downregulated only in immature leaves or only in mature leaves after 1 d of culturing.

A total amount of 3 µg RNA per sample was used as input material for the RNA sample preparations. Sequencing libraries were generated using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. We used an optimized data analysis workflow, and mapped about 45 million sequence clean reads per sample to the Arabidopsis genome and identified 33,685 transcripts in 2 and 6 dpg (day post germination) old wild type plant (Col-0). Among them, there are 9321 genes differentially expresses from 2- and 6-d-old plants, and 479 differentially expresses transcription factor (TF) genes.

PRJNA488799	Diel and circadian gating of Arabidopsis thermotolerance and transcriptional response to heat stress. (thale cress)	"Purpose: To understand time of day variation in Arabidopsis heat shock responses. We have observed significant differences in terms of plant survivability in response to a heat shock across various times of day. Because of this, we believe that transcriptional responses may be a significant underlying factor which contributes to the observed physiology and surivability after heat stress.
Methods: Whole plant tissue mRNA profiles in Col-0 Arabidopsis were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina HiSeq 2500. Tissue samples of four replicates were collected at two times of day (Dawn and Dusk, ZT0/ZT12) and were either control or heat stressed (30oC) for 1 hour. An additional 4 samples were collected in constant light conditions (single replicate) to quantify circadian effects. Sequence reads from each sample were mapped to the TAIR10 reference genome with Tophat2 and counts were obtained using Htseq-count. Differential expression analysis was done using DeSeq2 to calculate differential expression levels of each gene in the dataset.
Results: We identified 5512 differentially expressed transcripts with our DESeq2 based data analysis pipeline that involves characterizing gene expression profiles based on basal expression level, time of differential expression, and direction of differential expression. An additional interaction term analysis revealed 572 genes which showe time of day dependent responses to heat stress, meaning the response to heat stress differs depending on the time of day that the heat stress is perceived by the plant. Downstream analysis using gene ontology analysis tools (Pantherdb.org) and Cytoscape revealed strong differences in terms of response happening in the AM and PM gene expression networks. The significance of this work is that it is the first study to show that there is a significant difference in terms of transcriptional responses to heat stress in Arabidopsis where the differences were quantified by levels of mRNA expression.

PRJNA489081	Transcriptomic study of Arabidopsis roots overexpressing the brassinosteroid receptor BRL3, in control conditions and under severe drought (thale cress)	"Abstract: Drought is the primary cause of global agricultural losses and represents a major threat to worldwide food security. Currently, plant biotechnology stands out as the most promising strategy to increase crop growth in rain-fed conditions. The main mechanisms underlying drought resistance have been uncovered by studies of plant physiology and by engineering crops with drought-resistant genes. However, plants with enhanced drought resistance usually display lower levels of growth, highlighting the need to search for novel strategies capable of uncoupling drought resistance from growth. Here, we show that the brassinosteroid family of receptors, in addition to promoting growth, guides phenotypic adaptation to a great variety of drought stress traits analyzed herein. Whilst mutations in the ubiquitously localized BRI1 receptor pathway show an enhanced drought resistance at the expense of plant growth, we found that vascular-enriched BRL3 receptors confer drought tolerance without penalizing overall growth. Systematic analyses reveal that upon drought stress the BRL3 receptor pathway triggers the synthesis and mobilization of osmoprotectant metabolites, mainly proline and sugars. This preferentially occurs in the vascular tissues of the roots and favors overall plant growth. Altogether, our results uncover a new role for the spatial control of BR signaling in drought tolerance, and offer a novel strategy to address food security issues in an increasingly water-limited climate.

PRJNA489863	Small is big in Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosome (thale cress)	"Mitochondria are responsible for energy production through aerobic respiration and represent  the powerhouse of eukaryotic cells. Their metabolism and gene expression processes  combine bacterial-like features and traits that evolved in eukaryotes. Among mitochondrial  gene expression processes, translation remains the most elusive. In plants, while numerous  pentatricopeptide repeat (PPR) proteins are involved in all steps of gene expression, their  function in translation remains unclear. Here we present the biochemical characterisation of  Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes and identify their protein subunit composition.  Complementary biochemical approaches identify 19 plant specific mitoribosome proteins,  among which 10 are PPR proteins. The knock out mutations of ribosomal PPR (rPPR) genes  result in distinct macroscopic phenotypes including lethality or severe growth delays. The  molecular analysis of rppr1 mutants using ribosome profiling as well as the analysis of  mitochondrial protein levels reveal that rPPR1 is a generic translation factor, which is a novel  function for PPR proteins. Finally, single particle cryo-electron microscopy reveals the unique  structural architecture of Arabidopsis mitoribosomes, characterised by a very large small  ribosomal subunit, larger than the large subunit, bearing an additional RNA domain grafted  onto the head. Overall, our results show that Arabidopsis mitoribosomes are substantially  divergent from bacterial and other eukaryote mitoribosomes, both in terms of structure and of  protein content.

PRJNA490511	Identification of regulators of vascular proliferation (thale cress)	"Vascular tissue transports water and nutrients throughout the plant body and is consequently essential for growth and development. In Arabidopsis, the vascular tissue is initiated at the centre of the embryo.  During embryogenesis it is found in a characteristic diarch pattern with a central file of xylem cells with an adjacent layer of procambium on either side. Phloem poles are present on the outside of the procambium layers. Following germination a series of cell divisions results in the reorganisation of the vascular tissue which transitions to a radially symmetric structure. The RNA-seq data associated with this submission captures those early events. In 7-day old seedlings, wild type hypocotyl s have begun the process of change towards radial symmetry. In pxy mutants this process is stalled, and in 35S::CLE41 lines, radial expansion occurs prematurely. In root tissue of this age there is little evidence of the transition to radial symmetry in any of the genotypes tested. The RNA-seq dataset submitted will thus provide insight into the changes required to reorganise Arabidopsis vascular tissue as it transitions from primary to secondary growth.

PRJNA490691	Epigenetic signatures associated with paternally-expressed imprinted genes in the endosperm (thale cress)	"Genomic imprinting is an epigenetic phenomenon causing parental alleles to be active depending on their parent-of-origin. In plants, imprinted genes are mainly confined to the endosperm, an ephemeral tissue supporting embryo development. Differential methylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3) established by the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) is a major regulatory mechanism determining activity of paternally expressed imprinted genes (PEGs) in animals and plants.  Here, we show that the coding region of many PEGs is marked by an epigenetic signature of H3K27me3, H3K9me2 and CHG methylation and that the combination of these three modifications correlates with paternally-biased gene expression in the endosperm. The maternal alleles of PEGs are marked by CHG methylation in the central cell, indicating that the repressive epigenetic signature of PEGs is established before fertilization.

The results showed that the upregulation of JA-related genes occurred as an early response to wounding (mainly within 1 h), prior to the upregulation of auxin-related genes (from 2 to 12 h). These results indicated that JA responds rapidly to wounding and earlier than does auxin.

PRJNA493255	Natural depletion of H1 in sex cells causes DNA demethylation, heterochromatin decondensation and transposon activation (thale cress)	"Transposable elements (TEs) are largely inactive. Interestingly, a subset of TEs are naturally expressed in the vegetative cell (VC) of the male gametophyte, pollen in Arabidopsis. However, the extent and mechanism of such TE activation were unknown. Through RNA-seq, we identified pollen-activated TEs and annotated the transcriptional start sites (TSSs) and transcriptional termination sites (TTSs) using a program called Mikado. We have previously shown that H1 is expressed in sperm but not in VC, which prompted us to ectopically express H1 in VC for studying TE regulation through RNA-seq and bisulfite-seq. Our RNA-seq data shows that H1 expression in VC represses some of pollen-activated TEs. Furthermore, bisulfite-seq data from the pollen nuclei isolated via fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) shows that H1 expression in VC increases DNA methylation of some of H1-repressed TEs around their TSSs, while leaving other H1-repressed TEs unchanged in DNA methylation. Our results indicate that H1 represses TE expression through both DNA methylation-dependent and -independent mechanisms and that natural depletion of H1 in VC allows TEs to be activated.
Overall design: To identify pollen-activated TEs, we did RNA-seq using pollen grains from WT and four replicates were included. To find out if H1 expression in VC can repress TE expression, we performed RNA-seq using pollen grains from WT or pVC::H1 with three replicates being done for each genotype. Bisulfite-seq was performed using sperm nuclei (SN) and vegetative nuclei (VN) from WT as well as VN from pVC::H1. By comparing WT SN with WT VN, we want to show if pollen-activated TEs are regulated by DEMETER-mediated DNA demethylation and if H1 represses TE expression through DNA methylation regulation.

PRJNA493616	Mobilization of Pack-CACTA transposons in Arabidopsis suggests the mechanism of gene shuffling (thale cress)	"Pack-TYPE transposons are a unique class of potentially mobile non-autonomous elements that can capture, merge and relocate fragments of chromosomal DNA. It has been postulated that their activity accelerates the evolution of host genes. However, this important presumption is based only on the sequences of currently inactive Pack-TYPE transposons and the acquisition of chromosomal DNA has not been recorded in real time. Analysing the DNA copy number variation in hypomethylated Arabidopsis lines, we have now for the first time witnessed the mobilization of novel Pack-TYPE elements related to the CACTA transposon family, over several plant generations. Remarkably, these elements can insert into genes as closely spaced direct repeats and they frequently undergo incomplete excisions, resulting in the deletion of one of the end sequences. These properties suggest a mechanism of efficient acquisition of genic DNA residing between neighbouring Pack-TYPE transposons and its subsequent mobilization. Our work documents crucial steps in the formation of in vivo novel Pack-TYPE transposons, and thus the possible mechanism of gene shuffling mediated by this type of mobile element.

PRJNA494056	Targeted reprogramming of H3K27me3 resets epigenetic memory in plant paternal chromatin (thale cress)	"Epigenetic marks are reprogrammed in the gametes to reset genomic potential in the next generation. In most animal species, paternal chromatin is extensively reprogrammed through the global erasure of DNA methylation and the exchange of histones with protamine. Precisely how the paternal epigenome is reprogrammed in flowering plants remains unclear since sperm chromatin is not demethylated and histones are retained. Here, we show that the sperm-specific histone, H3.10, is immune to lysine 27 methylation and that its deposition in sperm contributes to the global and specific resetting of the epigenetic mark H3K27me3 by uncoupling its inheritance during DNA replication. The loss of H3K27me3 facilitates transcription of genes essential for spermatogenesis and pre-configures sperm with a chromatin state that forecasts gene expression in the next generation, revealing a global wave of epigenetic resetting that coordinates with early plant life. Thus, in contrast to the indiscriminate removal of epigenetic marks in animal sperm, plants have evolved a specific mechanism to simultaneously differentiate male gametes and reprogram the paternal epigenome.

PRJNA494061	A functional unfolded protein response is required for normal vegetative development in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The Unfolded Protein Response (UPR) is activated in plants in response to ER stress and plays an important role in mitigating stress damage.  We have analyzed an ire1a ire1b bzip17 triple mutant in Arabidopsis with defects in stress signaling and found that the mutant is also impaired in vegetative plant growth under conditions without externally applied stress. This raises the question as to whether the UPR functions in plant development in same manner as it does in responding to stress. bZIP17 is an ER-associated membrane transcription factor that is mobilized to the nucleus in response to stress.   Through the analysis of a mobilization defective bZIP17 mutant, we found that bZIP17 must be capable of mobilization to support normal plant development.  Likewise, through the analysis of ire1 mutants, we found that protein kinase and ribonuclease activities of IRE1 must be functional to support normal development.  These findings demonstrate that the UPR is active, albeit at low levels, during unstressed conditions, and that these activities are required for normal development.

PRJNA494179	Global identification of Arabidopsis lncRNAs reveals the regulation of MAF4 by a natural antisense RNA (thale cress)	"Long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) have emerged as important regulators of gene expression and plant development. Here, we identified 6,510 lncRNAs in Arabidopsis under normal or stress conditions. We found that the expression of natural antisense transcripts (NATs) that are transcribed in the opposite directionof protein-coding genes often positively correlates with and is required for theexpression of their cognate sense genes. We further characterized MAS, a NAT-lncRNA produced from the MADS AFFECTING FLOWERING4 (MAF4) locus.MAS is induced by cold and indispensable for the activation of MAF4 transcriptionand suppression of precocious flowering. MAS activates MAF4 by interacting with WDR5a, one core component of the COMPASS-like complexes, and recruiting WDR5a to MAF4 to enhance histone 3 lysine 4 trimethylation (H3K4me3). Our study greatly extends the repertoire of lncRNAs in Arabidopsis and reveals a role for NAT-lncRNAs in regulating gene expression in vernalization response and likely in other biological processes

PRJNA495335	Maternal to zygotic transition：A two-step process with two phases of ZGA occurs in zygote right after fertilization in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The goal of the present study is to analyze the characteristics of maternal to zygotic transition (MZT) in Arabidopsis.
The maternal-to-zygotic transition (MZT) is an essential developmental turning point during the alternation of generations in both plants and animals. In animals, early embryogenesis is maternally controlled and zygotic genome activation (ZGA) starts much later. However, in plants, the timing of MZT and parental contributions to the zygotic transcriptome remain unclear. To address above mentioned questions, we selected Arabidopsis as model plant for the analysis. Regarding to the characteristics of MZT, egg cells, embryos including spherical zygote, elongated zygote, 1-cell embryo and 32-cell embryo were isolated and collected for RNA sequencing. Hybrid zygotes at two representative stages from the reciprocal crosses between polymorphic Arabidopsis Columbia (Col) and Landsberg erecta (Ler) accessions were also sequenced for investigating the parental contributions. We demonstrate that plant MZT occurs during the zygote stage and is a two-step process, first involving rapid maternal transcript degradation and, second, large-scale de novo transcription. Parental contributions to the zygotic transcriptome are stage dependent over the course of zygote development; the spherical zygote is characterized by a maternally dominated transcriptome, whereas the elongated zygote genome shows equal parental contributions.

PRJNA495742	Approaches for Surveying Cosmic Radiation Damage in Large Populations of Arabidopsis thaliana Seeds- an Antarctic Example (thale cress)	"The Cosmic Ray Exposure Sequencing Science (CRESS) payload system is a proof of concept experiment to assess the genomic impact of space radiation on seeds. CRESS was designed as a secondary payload for the December 2016 high-altitude, high-latitude, and long-duration balloon flight carrying the Boron And Carbon Cosmic Rays in the Upper Stratosphere (BACCUS) experimental hardware. Investigation of the biological effects of Galactic Cosmic Radiation (GCR), particularly those of ions with High-Z and Energy (HZE), is of interest due to the genomic damage this type of radiation inflicts. The biological effects of upper-stratospheric mixed radiation above Antarctica (ANT) were sampled using Arabidopsis thaliana seeds and were compared to those resulting from a controlled simulation of GCR at Brookhaven National Laboratory (BNL) and to laboratory control seed. The payload developed for Antarctica exposure was broadly designed to 1U CubeSat specifications (10cmx10cmx10cm, ≤1.33kg), maintained 1 atm internal pressure, and carried an internal cargo of four seed trays (about 580,000 seeds) and twelve CR-39 Solid-State Nuclear Track Detectors (SSNTDs). The irradiated seeds were recovered, sterilized and grown on Petri plates for phenotypic screening. BNL and ANT M0 seeds showed significantly reduced germination rates and elevated somatic mutation rates when compared to non-irradiated controls, with the BNL mutation rate also being significantly higher than that of ANT. Genomic DNA from mutants of interest was evaluated with whole-genome sequencing using PacBio SMRT technology. Sequence data revealed the presence of an array of genome structural variants in the genomes of M0 and M1 mutant plants.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the Columbia (Col-0) ecotype were placed into 24 x 24 bin seed trays (modified 1536-well plates) with bins which were then covered by polyolefin sealant film [USA Scientific] and flanked by CR-39 SSNTDs, for two non-concurrent exposures. In the BNL exposure, one seed tray with three CR-39 sheets on each side was placed in a modified T-25 flask for irradiation (H, 250 MeV, 10.62 Rad; He, 250 MeV, 3.165 Rad; O, 350 MeV, 1.08 Rad; Ti, 300 MeV, 0.735 Rad). The Antarctica exposure was 30 days in duration at an altitude of ~35 km. Four seed trays were arranged in a stack with three CR-39 plates at each end, and two sheets between each tray. After irradiation, seeds were returned to the University of Florida and stored at -20 °C until planting. Seeds were planted on Phytagel™-based nutrient media and grown for 14 days, at which time Petri plates were evaluated for germination and mutation rates. Mutants of interest were tracked, and preserved in liquid nitrogen if growth was deemed too impaired for the plant to mature. Whole genomic DNA was extracted from 10 mutants, which was used to prepare SMRT-Bell libraries (4 individual mutants, 1 pool of 6 mutants).

PRJNA495850	Excess light priming in Arabidopsis thaliana genotypes with altered DNA methylomes (thale cress)	"Plants must continuously react to the ever-fluctuating nature of their environment. Repeated exposure to stressful conditions can lead to priming, whereby prior encounters heighten a plant’s ability to respond to future events. A clear example of priming is provided by the model plant species Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis), in which photosynthetic and photoprotective responses are enhanced following recurring light stress. While there are various post-translational mechanisms underpinning photoprotection, an unresolved question is the relative importance of transcriptional changes towards stress priming and, consequently, the potential contribution from DNA methylation – a heritable chemical modification of DNA capable of influencing gene expression. Here, we systematically investigate the potential molecular underpinnings of physiological priming against recurring excess light (EL), specifically DNA methylation and transcriptional regulation: the latter having not been examined with respect to EL priming. The capacity for physiological priming of photosynthetic and photoprotective parameters following a recurring EL treatment was not impaired in Arabidopsis mutants with perturbed establishment, maintenance and removal of DNA methylation, nor was the transmission of this priming into naive tissues developed in the absence of excess light. Importantly, no differences in developmental or basal photoprotective capacity were identified in the mutants that may confound the above result. Little evidence for a causal transcriptional component of physiological priming was identified; in fact, most alterations in primed plants presented as a transcriptional ‘dampening’ in response to an additional EL exposure, likely a consequential of physiological priming. However, a set of transcripts uniquely regulated in primed plants provide preliminary evidence for a novel transcriptional component of recurring EL priming, independent of physiological changes. Thus, we propose that physiological priming of recurring EL in Arabidopsis occurs independently of DNA methylation; and that the majority of the associated transcriptional alterations are a consequence, not cause, of this physiological priming.
Overall design: Experiments were performed using recurring excess-light treatments on Arabidopsis thaliana. MethylC-seq was performed on 3 replicates of unstressed Col-0 and strs2  plants. RNA-seq was performed on 3 replicates of naïve, naïve-triggered, primed, and primed-triggered plants. Less..."

Library construction and sequencing were performed as described elsewhere, based on RNA extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 7-day-old seedlings of 35S-ARF18-OE-2 and Col. The RNA was purified by electrophoresis through a TBE-urea polyacrylamide gel. The gel regions harboring 18-30 nt fragments were excised and the RNA recovered. The resulting population of sRNAs was 5’ and 3’ RNA adaptor-ligated using T4 RNA ligase and amplified for 18 PCR cycles. The amplicons were purified and sequenced using an Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, China). Raw reads were trimmed by removing low-quality and adaptor sequences, and then they were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome using SOAP2 software. Transcript frequency was calculated using the reads per kilobase per million reads method. Differentially transcribed genes were identified using a method modified from Audic and Claverie (1997). Significance was based on the p value and the false discovery rate (FDR) (Audic and Claverie, 1997). The chosen thresholds were FDR ≤ 0.001 and |log2| ≥ 1.

PRJNA496426	The embryonic transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Cellular differentiation is associated with changes in transcript populations. Accurate quantification of transcriptomes during development can thus provide global insights into differentiation processes including the fundamental specification and differentiation events operating during plant embryogenesis. However, multiple technical challenges have limited the ability to obtain high quality early embryonic transcriptomes, namely the low amount of RNA obtainable and contamination from surrounding endosperm and seed-coat tissues. We compared the performance of three low-input mRNA sequencing (mRNA-seq) library preparation kits on 0.1 to 5 nanograms (ng) of total RNA isolated from Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis) embryos and identified a low-cost method with superior performance. This mRNA-seq method was then used to profile the transcriptomes of Arabidopsis embryos across eight developmental stages. By comprehensively comparing embryonic and post-embryonic transcriptomes, we found that embryonic transcriptomes do not resemble any other plant tissue we analyzed. Moreover, transcriptome clustering analyses revealed the presence of four distinct phases of embryogenesis which are enriched in specific biological processes. We also compared zygotic embryo transcriptomes with publicly available somatic embryo transcriptomes. Strikingly, we found little resemblance between zygotic embryos and somatic embryos derived from late-staged zygotic embryos suggesting that somatic and zygotic embryo transcriptomes are distinct from each other. In addition to the biological insights gained from our systematic characterization of the Arabidopsis embryonic transcriptome, we provide a data-rich resource for the community to explore.
Overall design: mRNA-seq libraries were generated from three biological replicates of 50 Col-0 (wild type) embryos at eight different developmental stages (i.e. 8-cell/16-cell to mature green).

PRJNA497374	The Protein Phosphatase 4 Complex Promotes Transcription and Processing of Primary microRNAs in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Protein phosphatase 4 (PP4) is a highly conserved serine/threonine protein phosphatase in yeast, plants, and animals. The composition and functions of the plant PP4 are poorly understood. Here, we uncovered previously unsuspected complexity of Arabidopsis PP4 and identified the composition of one form of PP4 containing the regulatory subunit PP4R3A. We showed that PP4R3A, together with one of two redundant catalytic subunit genes PPX1 and PPX2, promotes the biogenesis of microRNAs. PP4R3A is a chromatin-associated protein, interacts with RNA polymerase II (Pol II), and recruits Pol II to the promoters of MIR genes to promote their transcription. PP4R3A probably also promotes the cotranscriptional processing of miRNA precursors as it recruits the microprocessor component HYPONASTIC LEAVES1 (HYL1) to MIR genes and nuclear dicing bodies. Moreover, we showed that hundreds of introns exhibit splicing defects in pp4r3a mutants. Together, this study revealed a role of Arabidopsis PP4 in transcription and nuclear RNA metabolism.

PRJNA497806	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of PSKγ1ox and control Transcriptomes (thale cress)	"Phytosulfokine-α (PSK-α), a sulfated pentapeptide hormone with the sequence YIYTQ, plays important roles in many aspects of plant growth and development. In this study, we identified a pair of putative precursor genes in soybean, GmPSKγ1 and -2, encoding a PSK-like peptide: PSK-γ. Similar to PSK-α in amino acid composition, the sequence of PSK-γ is YVYTQ, and the tyrosines undergo sulfonylation. Treatment of Arabidopsis seedlings with synthetic sulfated PSK-γ significantly enhanced root elongation, indicating that PSK-γ might be a functional analog of PSK-α. Expression pattern analysis revealed that the two GmPSKγ genes, especially GmPSKγ1, are primarily expressed in developing soybean seeds. Heterologous expression of GmPSKγ1 under the control of a seed-specific promoter markedly increased seed size and weight in Arabidopsis, and this promoting effect of PSK-γ on seed growth was further confirmed in transgenic tobacco constitutively expressing GmPSKγ1. Cytological analysis of transgenic Arabidopsis seeds revealed that PSK-γ promotes seed growth by inducing embryo cell expansion. In addition, transcriptome analysis of GmPSKγ1-expressing Arabidopsis seeds suggested that PSK-γ signaling may regulate cell wall loosening to promote cell expansion. Overall, our results shed light on the mechanism by which PSK-γ promotes seed growth, paving the way for the use of this new peptide for biotechnological improvement of crop seed/grain size and yield.
Overall design: Seed (10 DAP) transcriptomes of  OLEOp:GmPSKγ1 and OLEOp:GmPSKγ1tc (control) were generated by deep sequencing using Illumina Hiseq 2500.

However, how cellular R-loops are sensed remain poorly understood. Here we report the discovery of the evolutionally conserved ALBA proteins (AtALBA1&2) functioning as the R-loops sensor of genic regions in higher plant Arabidopsis thaliana. AtALBA1 and 2 form a heterodimer protein complex and localize in the nucleus. While AtALBA1 binds to the DNA-RNA hybrid strand, AtALBA2 associates with single-stranded DNA in the R-loops. AtALBA1&2 preferentially binds to the genic R-loop regions that are associated with active epigenetic marks. Depletion of AtALBA1 or AtALBA2 results in hypersensitivity of plants to DNA damaging agents. Our results demonstrate the AtALBA1&2 protein complex is the Arabidopsis genic R-loops sensor for maintaining genome stability in Arabidopsis.

Here, we present m7G Mutational Profiling sequencing (m7G-MaP-seq), which allows high throughput detection of m7G modifications. In our method, m7G modified positions are converted to abasic sites by mild reduction, recorded as cDNA mutations through reverse transcription, sequenced and subsequently detected by identification of positions with increased mutation rates in the reduced sample compared to the control. We show that m7G-MaP-seq efficiently detects m7G modifications in rRNA, including a previously uncharacterised rRNA modification in Arabidopsis thaliana. Furthermore, we identify m7G tRNA modifications in budding yeast, human and arabidopsis tRNA and show that m7G modification occurs before tRNA splicing. We do not find any evidence for internal m7G modifications being present in other small RNA, such as miRNA, snoRNA and sRNA. Likewise, high coverage m7G-MaP-seq analysis of mRNA from E. coli or yeast cells failed to identify any internal m7G modifications.

PRJNA505255	miR167 limits anther growth to potentiate anther dehiscence (thale cress)	"In flowering plants, anther dehiscence and pollen release are essential for sexual reproduction.  Anthers dehisce after cell wall degradation weakens stomium cell junctions in each anther locule, and desiccation creates mechanical forces that open the locules.  Either effect or both together may break stomium cell junctions.  The microRNA miR167 negatively regulates ARF6 and ARF8, which encode Auxin Response transcription Factors.  Arabidopsis mARF6 or mARF8 plants with mutated miR167 target sites have defective anther dehiscence and ovule development.  Null mir167a mutations recapitulated mARF6 and mARF8 anther and ovule phenotypes, indicating that MIR167a is the main miR167 precursor gene that delimits ARF6 and ARF8 expression in these organs.  Anthers of mir167a or mARF6/8 plants overexpressed genes encoding cell wall loosening functions associated with cell expansion, and grew too large starting at flower stage 11.  Experimental desiccation enabled dehiscence of miR167-deficient anthers, indicating competence to dehisce.  Conversely, high humidity conditions delayed anther dehiscence in wild-type flowers.  These results support a model in which miR167-mediated anther growth arrest permits anther dehiscence.  Without miR167 regulation, excess anther growth delays dehiscence by prolonging desiccation.
Overall design: The dataset includes experiments from two tissues, stamens or gynoecia.  Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown in 14:10 h day:night cycles.  Tissue samples for RNA isolation were collected between 1 and 3 hours after dawn, and immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen.  Stage 11 flower buds used for stamen isolation (sample groups F, G, H) were 1.5-1.8 mm long, generally corresponding to 3 to 5 flowers before the first open flower.  Stamens at this stage still appeared green before turning yellow at flower stage 12.  Tissue for the gynoecium experiment (sample groups A, B, C, D, E) was from stage 12 flowers with gynoecia of 0.9 to 1.4 mm long.
For RNA-Seq, RNA was isolated using the Rneasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen) according to manufacturer’s instructions.  Libraries were constructed with the Truseq mRNA library prep kit (Illumina) according to manufacturer’s instructions.

PRJNA505275	AT-hook transcription factors repress petiole growth by antagonizing PIF4 [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"As sessile organisms, plants rely heavily on growth and developmental plasticity to respond to external challenges threatening their survival. Strict regulation of growth in organs such as hypocotyls and petioles enables plants to respond optimally to varying environmental conditions, such as changes in light and temperature, while also ensuring that resources are not needlessly wasted on unnecessary growth. Studies performed in Arabidopsis thaliana have established the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF) transcription factor family as key positive regulators of growth, particularly in hypocotyls and petioles. In this study, we identify members of the AT-HOOK MOTIF NUCLEAR LOCALIZED (AHL) family, including SUPPRESSOR OF PHYTOCHROME B4-#3 (SOB3), as repressors of PIF4-mediated petiole elongation. Specifically, we found that high levels of SOB3 lead to a short-petiole phenotype similar to that conferred by removal of PIF4. Conversely, the dominant-negative sob3-6 mutant has long petioles, a phenotype which is dependent on PIF4. Additionally, we show that AHLs repress the expression of many PIF-activated genes, including a number involved in hormone-mediated promotion of growth and a subset of which are directly bound by both SOB3 and PIFs. Taken together these results suggest that AHLs repress petiole growth by antagonizing PIF-mediated transcriptional activation of growth-promoting genes, including ARABIDOPSIS THALIANA HOMEOBOX PROTEIN 2 (ATHB2), BRASSINOSTEROID INSENSITIVE 1 (BRI1), INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID INDUCIBLE 19 (IAA19), PIN-FORMED 3 (PIN3), SMALL AUXIN UP RNA 24 (SAUR24), and YUCCA8 (YUC8). Elucidating a mechanism by which positive and negative growth factors influence growth in petioles achieves a critical first step towards understanding the gene regulatory networks which modulate leaf growth in response to the environment.

In the context of the apical plant stem cell system, local accumulation of the small, highly mobile phytohormone auxin triggers organ initiation. Here we show that the WUSCHEL transcription factor locally protects stem cells from differentiation by controlling the auxin signaling and response pathways via regulation of Histone acetylation. Conversely, low levels of signaling are required for stem cell maintenance, demonstrating that WUSCHEL acts as a rheostat on the auxin pathway. Our results reveal an important mechanism that allows cells to differentially translate a potent and highly mobile developmental signal into appropriate cell behavior with high spatial precision and temporal robustness.

PRJNA506260	RNA-seq from roots of 14 day old col-0 Arabidopsis thaliana carrying INTACT (thale cress)	"Background:   There is a growing interest in the role of chromatin in acquiring and maintaining cell identity. Despite the ever growing availability of genome-wide gene expression data, understanding how transcription programs are established and regulated to define cell identity remains a puzzle. An important mechanism of gene regulation is the binding of transcription factors to specific DNA sequence motifs across the genome. However, these sequences are hindered by the packaging of DNA to chromatin. Thus the accessibility of these loci for TF binding is highly regulated and determines where and when TF bind. We present a workflow for measuring chromatin accessibility in Arabidopsis thaliana, and define organ-specific regulatory sites and binding motifs of transcription factors at these sites.
Results:   We coupled the recently described INTACT (Isolation of Nuclei TAgged in specific Cell Types) and ATAC-seq (Assay for Transposase-Accessible Chromatin with highthroughput sequencing) as a genome-wide strategy to uncover accessible regulatory sites in Arabidopsis, based on their accessibility to nuclease digestion. By applying this pipeline in Arabidopsis roots, we revealed 41,419 accessible sites, of which approximately half are found in gene promoters and contain the H3K4me3 active histone mark. The root-unique accessible sites from this group are enriched for root processes. Interestingly, most of the root-unique accessible sites are found in nongenic regions, but are correlated with root-specific expression of distant genes. Importantly these gene-distant sites are enriched for binding motifs of TFs important for root development, as well as motifs for TFs that may play a role as novel transcriptional regulators in roots, suggesting that these accessible loci are functional novel genedistant regulatory elements.
Conclusion:   By coupling the INTACT with ATAC-seq methods, we present a feasible pipeline to profile accessible chromatin in plants. We also introduce a rapid measure of the experiment quality. We find that chromatin accessibility at promoter regions is strongly associated with transcription and active histone marks. However, root specific chromatin accessibility is primarily found at intergenic regions, suggesting their predominance in defining organ identity, possibly via long-range chromatin interactions. This workflow can be rapidly applied to study the regulatory landscape in other cell types, plant species and conditions.
Overall design: Roots were harvested from 14-day old seedlings from transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana col-0 roots, containing a single-plasmid INATCT system under the constitutive 35S promoter.

PRJNA507972	Arabidopsis SWR1-associated protein methyl-CpG-binding domain 9 is required for histone H2A.Z deposition. [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Deposition of histone variant H2A.Z by the SWR1 chromatin-remodeling complex is critical for the appropriate expression of many genes in eukaryotes, yet, despite its importance, the composition of the Arabidopsis SWR1 complex has not been thoroughly analyzed.  Here we have identified the interacting partners of a conserved Arabidopsis SWR1 subunit, actin-related protein 6 (ARP6). We isolated 9 predicted components, identifying subunits implicated in histone acetylation and interacting partners implicated in chromatin biology. We found that the  methyl-CpG-binding domain 9 (MBD9) subunit functioned synergistically with ARP6 to control flowering time. MBD9, in combination with ARP6, was involved in the SWR1-mediated incorporation of the majority of H2A.Z. MBD6 was further required for deposition of H2A.Z at a distinct subset of loci. MBD9 was preferentially bound to nucleosome-depleted regions at the 5’ of genes containing high levels of activating histone marks. Our data suggests a model for MBD9 in recruiting the SWR1 complex to open chromatin of actively transcribing genes.

PRJNA508516	RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) analysis of leaf and root of Col grown on 1/2 MS with or without PS-SO3H or PS-NH2 nanoplastics treatment (thale cress)	"The goals of this study are to find the differential expression genes after PS-SO3H or PS-NH2 nanoplastics treatment, to explain why the PS-SO3H or PS-NH2 nanoplastics have inhibited the root growth.
Overall design: The RNA was extracted from 10-day-old leaf and root of Col grown on 1/2 MS with or without PS-SO3H or PS-NH2 nanoplastics treatment.
Library construction and sequencing were performed as described elsewhere, based on RNA extracted with the TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) from 10-day-old seedlings grown on 1/2 MS containing PS-SO3H or PS-NH2 nanoplastics. The RNA was purified by electrophoresis through a TBE-urea polyacrylamide gel. The gel regions harboring 18-30 nt fragments were excised and the RNA recovered. The resulting population of sRNAs was 5’ and 3’ RNA adaptor-ligated using T4 RNA ligase and amplified for 18 PCR cycles. The amplicons were purified and sequenced using an Illumina/Solexa Genome Analyzer (Beijing Genomics Institute, Shenzhen, China). Raw reads were trimmed by removing low-quality and adaptor sequences, and then they were aligned to the Arabidopsis genome using SOAP2 software. Transcript frequency was calculated using the reads per kilobase per million reads method. Differentially transcribed genes were identified using a method modified from Audic and Claverie (1997). Significance was based on the p value and the false discovery rate (FDR) (Audic and Claverie, 1997). The chosen thresholds were FDR ≤ 0.001 and |log2| ≥ 1.

PRJNA508784	Oxygen-dependent proteolysis regulates the stability of angiosperm Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 subunit VERNALIZATION2 (thale cress)	"The polycomb repressive complex 2 (PRC2) regulates epigenetic gene repression in eukaryotes.  Mechanisms controlling its developmental specificity and signal-responsiveness are poorly understood.  Here, we identify an oxygen-sensitive N-terminal (N-) degron in the plant PRC2 subunit VERNALIZATION(VRN)2, a homolog of animal Su(z)12, that promotes its degradation via the N-end rule pathway.  We provide evidence that this N-degron arose early during angiosperm evolution via gene duplication and N-terminal truncation, facilitating expansion of PRC2 function in flowering plants.  We show that proteolysis via the N-end rule pathway prevents ectopic VRN2 accumulation, and that hypoxia and long-term cold exposure lead to increased VRN2 abundance, which we propose may be due to inhibition of VRN2 turnover via its N-degron.  Furthermore, we identify an overlap in the transcriptional responses to hypoxia and prolonged cold, and show that VRN2 promotes tolerance to hypoxia. Our work reveals a mechanism for post-translational regulation of VRN2 stability that could potentially link environmental inputs to the epigenetic control of plant development.
Overall design: RNA was extracted from non-vernalized (0v; C) or 4 week vernalized (4v; V) seedlings.  Three biological replicates for each treatment were used for subsequent RNA sequencing Less..."

PRJNA509070	Gadolinium protects Arabidopsis thaliana against  Botrytis cinerea through the activation of JA/ET-induced  defense responses (thale cress)	"Plant food production is severely affected by fungi; to cope with this problem, farmers use synthetic fungicides. However, the need to reduce fungicide application has led to a search for alternatives, such as biostimulants. Rare-earth elements (REEs) are widely used as biostimulants, but their mode of action and their potential as an alternative to synthetic fungicides have not been fully studied. Here, the biostimulant effect of gadolinium (Gd) is explored using the plant-pathosystem Arabidopsis thaliana–Botrytis cinerea . We determine that Gd induces local, systemic, and long-lasting plant defense responses to B. cinerea, without affecting fungal development. The physiological changes induced by Gd have been related to its structural resemblance to calcium. However, our results show that the calcium-induced defense response is not sufficient to protect plants against B. cinerea, compared to Gd. Furthermore, a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis shows that Gd induces plant defenses and modifies early and late defense responses. However, the resistance to B. cinerea is dependent on JA/ET-induced responses. These data support the conclusion that Gd can be used as a biocontrol agent for B. cinerea. These results are a valuable tool to uncover the molecular mechanisms induced by REEs.

PRJNA509225	Mediator12 and 13 act as conditional anti-silencing factors in Arabidopsis  [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Mediator is a multi-protein complex which facilitates the initial steps of gene transcription. Mediator 12 (MED12) and MED13 are components of a module that reversibly associates with the core Mediator complex, and both positively and negatively regulates gene expression. Here, in an Arabidopsis mutant screen for factors that can bypass repressive epigenetic marks, we identified MED12 and MED13 as anti-silencing factors. Both are preferentially required for the expression of genes in the absence of H3K4me3, an activating chromatin mark. Thus, MED12 and MED13 respond to specific epigenetic states and can act as conditional positive gene regulators in Arabidopsis.
Overall design: In each experiments, a minimum of three replicates were analyzed. cct-2 and gct-2 mutants were compared to columbia-0. GFP-morc1/med12 and GFP-morc1/med13 were compared to GFP-morc1.

PRJNA509341	Functional relationship of GUN1 and FUG1 in plastid proteostasis (thale cress)	"GUN1 integrates retrograde signals in the chloroplast but the underlying mechanism is elusive. FUG1, a chloroplast translation initiation factor, and GUN1 are co-expressed at the transcript level, and FUG1 co-immunoprecipitates with GUN1. We used mutants of GUN1 (gun1-103) and FUG1 (fug1-3) to analyse their functional relationship at the physiological and systems-wide level, the latter including transcriptome and proteome analyses. Absence of GUN1 aggravates the effects of decreased FUG1 levels on chloroplast protein translation, resulting in transient additive phenotypes with respect to photosynthesis, leaf coloration, growth and cold acclimation. Variegation of the var2 mutant is enhanced by gun1-103 in terms of increasing the fraction of white sectors, in contrast to fug1-3 that acts as suppressor. The transcriptomes of fug1-3 and gun1-103 are very similar, but absence of GUN1 alone has almost no effects on protein levels, whereas chloroplast protein accumulation is markedly decreased in fug1-3. In gun1 fug1 double mutants, effects on transcriptomes and particularly proteomes are enhanced. Our results show that GUN1 function becomes critical when chloroplast proteostasis is perturbed by decreased translation (fug1) or degradation (var2) of chloroplast proteins. The functions of FUG1 and GUN1 appear to be related, corroborating the view that GUN1 operates in chloroplast proteostasis.

PRJNA509360	Low-input chromatin profiling in Arabidopsis endosperm using CUT&RUN (thale cress)	"Endosperm is an essential seed tissue with a unique epigenetic landscape. During endosperm development, differential epigenetic regulation of the maternal and paternal genomes plays important roles in regulating gene expression, especially at imprinted genes. Profiling the endosperm epigenetic landscape on a genome-wide scale is challenging due to its small size, mode of development, and close association with maternal tissue. Here, we applied a low input chromatin profiling method, CUT&RUN (cleavage under targets and release using nuclease), to profile parental-specific chromatin modifications using low numbers of Arabidopsis endosperm nuclei. We demonstrate that CUT&RUN generates genome-wide H3K27me3 landscapes with high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility using around 20,000 endosperm nuclei purified by flow cytometry and fluorescence-activated cell sorting. H3K27me3 peaks identified by CUT&RUN and previous ChIP (chromatin immunoprecipitation) approaches were largely overlapping, with some distinctions in heterochromatin. The versatility and simplicity of CUT&RUN makes it a viable alternative to ChIP, which requires greater amounts of starting material, and will enable the study of tissue or even cell-type specific epigenomes in Arabidopsis and other plant species.
Overall design: Col plants were emasculated and pollinated by Ler pollens two days later. Seeds were removed from siliques and nuclei from these seeds were extracted using Partec CyStain UV Precise P and immediately FACS sorted based on DAPI. For test experiments using seed coat and embryo nuclei, seeds were removed from siliques sever days after pollination. 2N, 4N and 8N nuclei were collected for CUT&RUN with anti H3K27me3 antibodies or no antibody. For endosperm CUT&RUN, seeds were removed from siliques four days after pollination (embryo at globular stage). 6N nuclei were collected for CUT&RUN either directly without formaldehyde fixation (Unfixed) or after formaldehyde fixation (Fixed). Anti H3 or H3K27me3 antibodies were used in CUT&RUN to profile H3, H3K27me3 landscapes. Normal rabbit IgG were used to generate negative control data. For leaf CUT&RUN, leaves were taken from 3-week-old Col plants. Leaf nuclei was extracted using Partec CyStain UV Precise P for FACS sorting and 2N, 4N and 8N nuclei were collected for CUT&RUN.

The exogenous treatment with glutamate (Glu), an important amino acid for living organisms, was shown to induce resistance against fungal pathogen in rice and tomato.

Here, we found that exogenous treatment with Glu to Arabidopsis enhances resistance against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 and Colletotrichum higginsianum. Consistently, transcriptome analyses of Arabidopsis seedlings treated with Glu showed that Glu significantly induces the expression of wound, defense, and stress related genes. Interestingly, Glu activates the expression of pathogen or damage associated molecular patterns (PAMP or DAMP)–inducible genes at much later time points than PAMP/DAMPs normally do. Moreover, expression of Glu-inducible genes does not require known components of PAMP receptor complex, glutamate receptors, salicylic acid-biosynthesis enzyme, or glutamate decarboxylase. In addition, Glu also enhances PAMP-inducible immune responses, such as production of reactive oxygen species and mitogen-activated protein kinase activation.

PRJNA509460	Compared gene expression during seed germination (12 hai) in the nac25 (KO2) and nac1L (KO1) null mutants and wild-type (Columbia-0) controls using deep sequencing of RNA populations (RNA-seq). (thale cress)	"A key component of seed germination is the interplay of mechanical forces governing embryo growth and the surrounding restraining endosperm tissue. Endosperm cell separation is therefore thought to play a critical role in the control of this developmental transition. Here we demonstrate that in Arabidopsis thaliana seeds, endosperm cell expansion is a key component of germination. Endosperm cells expand to accommodate embryo growth prior to germination. We show that this is an actively regulated process supported by spatiotemporal control of the cell expansion gene EXPANSIN 2 (EXPA2). The NAC transcription factors NAC25 and NAC1L were identified as upstream regulatory effectors of EXPA2 expression, GA-mediated endosperm expansion and seed germination. The DELLA protein RGL2 repressed activation of EXPA2 promoter by NAC. Our findings demonstrate a key role of this gene network in regulating endosperm cell-expansion to control the seed to seedling transition.

PRJNA509920	Spatiotemporal Developmental Trajectories in the Arabidopsis Root Revealed Using High-Throughput Single Cell RNA Sequencing (thale cress)	"A single cell RNA sequencing atlas of the Arabidopsis root distinguishes cells both by developmental fate and time, revealing defining expression features that depict a complex cascade of developmental progressions from stem cell through differentiation supported by mirroring waves of transcription factor expression.
Methods: mRNA profiles of 6-day-old wild-type (WT) and shortroot-knockout Arabidopsis thaliana roots were generated by deep sequencing of single cell (all) and bulk RNA libraries (wild type only), in duplicate (bulk & wild-type single cell) and singlicate (shr-3), using Illumina NextSeq. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript level. Single Cell libraries were processed and analysed using Cell Ranger, STAR, Seurat. Bulk libraries were processed using Trimmomatic, STAR, HTSeq and DEseq2.
Results: For Single Cell - Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped ~87k sequence reads per wild-type cell to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) and identified a median of 4,276 genes and 14,758 transcripts per cell. In total, transcripts for 16,975 genes were detected (RPM ≥1) from wild-type cells. After correction for read depth, this represents ~90% of genes detected by bulk RNA-seq of protoplasted root tissue. Bulk RNA-seq data identified genes induced by protplasting of the Arabidopsis root which could be discounted from single cell analysis. The global gene expression profiles of pooled scRNA-seq and bulk RNA-seq are highly correlated (r = 0.9) indicating that plant scRNA-seq is highly sensitive.
Conclusions: Our high-resolution single cell RNA sequencing atlas of the Arabidopsis root captures precise temporal information for all major cell types, revealing new regulators and defining features foreach. Developmental trajectories derived from pseudotime analysis depict a finely resolved cascade of developmental progressions between stem cell and final differentiation supported by mirroring waves of transcription factor expression.

PRJNA510767	Functional characterization of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE 3 in reproductive tissue (thale cress)	"Arabidopsis encodes ten ARGONAUTE (AGO) effectors of RNA silencing, canonically loaded with either 21-22nt small RNAs (sRNA) to mediate post-transcriptional-gene-silencing (PTGS) or 24nt sRNAs to promote RNA-directed-DNA-methylation. Using full-locus constructs, we characterized the expression, biochemical properties, and possible modes of action of AGO3. Although AGO3 arose from a recent duplication at the AGO2 locus, their expression differs drastically, with AGO3 prevailing in aerial vascular terminations and specifically in chalazal seed integuments; accordingly, AGO3 down-regulation alters gene expression in siliques. Similar to AGO2, AGO3 binds sRNAs with a strong 5’-adenosine bias, but unlike most Arabidopsis AGOs - AGO2 included - it binds efficiently both 24nt and 21nt sRNAs. AGO3 immuno precipitation experiments in siliques revealed that these sRNAs mostly associate to genes and intergenic regions and not to canonical AGO targets, such as transposable elements. AGO3 localizes to the cytoplasm and co-fractionates with polysomes to possibly mediate PTGS via translation inhibition.
Overall design: For mRNA sequencing, 2 biological samples per genotype were assessed. Samples were: ago3-3 homozygous, ago3-3 heterozygous, and Columbia 0 wilt-type samples.

PRJNA510780	Auxin regulates endosperm cellularization in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The endosperm is an ephemeral tissue that nourishes the developing embryo, similar to the placenta in mammals. In most angiosperms, endosperm development starts as a syncytium, in which nuclear divisions are not followed by cytokinesis. The timing of endosperm cellularization largely varies between species, and the event triggering this transition remains unknown. Here we show that increased auxin biosynthesis in the endosperm prevents its cellularization, leading to seed arrest. Auxin-overproducing seeds phenocopy paternal-excess triploid seeds derived from hybridizations of diploid maternal plants with tetraploid fathers. Concurrently, auxin-related genes are strongly overexpressed in triploid seeds, correlating with increased auxin activity. Reducing auxin biosynthesis and signaling reestablishes endosperm cellularization in triploid seeds and restores their viability, highlighting a causal role of increased auxin in preventing endosperm cellularization. We propose that auxin determines the time of endosperm cellularization, and thereby uncovered a central role of auxin in establishing hybridization barriers in plants.
Overall design: We extracted total RNA from 6 DAP WT and DD25::IaaH seeds, using the MagJET Plant RNA Purification Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific).

In this study, we performed a genome-wide ribosome profiling in Arabidopsis upon ETI activation and discovered that specific groups of genes were translationally regulated, especially metabolic genes in aromatic amino acid, phenylpropanoid, camalexin, and sphingolipid metabolism. The involvement of these components in the induction of ETI was confirmed by genetic analysis, amino acid profiling and exogeneous application of phenylalanine or an inhibitor of aromatic amino acid biosynthesis. Our findings provide new insight into the diverse translational regulation in the plant immune responses and demonstrate that translational coordination of metabolic gene expression is an important strategy for ETI activation.

One key step of translation is the association between eIF4E and eIF4G. This process is regulated in different eukaryotes by proteins which bind to eIF4E and block the formation of the eIF4E/eIF4G complex. Here, we report the discovery of CERES, the first functional eIF4E regulator described in plants. CERES is a modular protein that contains a LRR domain and a canonical eIF4E binding site (4E-BS), critical for CERES interaction with eIF4E in planta. CERES/eIF4E interaction excludes eIF4G from the complex. Despite this observation, CERES promotes translation in vivo interacts with eIF4A and with eIF3 in vivo and cosediments with translation initiation complexes in sucrose gradients. Moreover, ceres mutants display a sharp increase of the 80S peak and a reduction of polysome content at specific periods of the diel cycle. Super-resolution ribosome profiling demonstrates that these mutants show a change of translation efficiency of mRNAs related to light response and glucose management. Consistently, these mutants show a hypersensitive response to glucose. These data show that CERES is a “non canonical” translation initiation factor that, through the formation of alternative translation initiation complexes, modulates translation during the light cycle in plants.

Differently from S. cerevisiae in which a single SET1 protein catalyzes H3 Lys-4 trimethylation as part of COMPASS (COMPlex of proteins ASsociated with SET1), this activity involves multiple histone methyltransferases (HMTs) in Arabidopsis thaliana, among which the plant-specific SDG2 (SET DOMAIN GROUP2) has a prominent role. Here we report that SDG2 co-regulates hundreds genes with SWD2-like b (S2Lb), a plant ortholog of the Swd2 axillary subunit of the evolutionarily conserved COMPASS complex. Accordingly, S2Lb associates with the AtCOMPASS core subunit WDR5a within a high-molecular weight complex and is required for proper H3K4me3 enrichment over genes highly occupied by RNA Polymerase II. S2Lb knock-out plants display little transcriptomic defects, suggesting that H3K4me3 deposition is important for optimal gene induction rather than for determining on/off transcriptional states. We further report that S2Lb and H3K4me3 are accurately targeted over most genes in hub1 mutant plants lacking histone H2B monoubiquitination. Collectively, our study indicates that a plant-specific COMPASS-like complex acting mainly through an H2Bub-independent mechanism is a major determinant of H3K4me3 deposition in Arabidopsis.

Here, a large scale circRNA profiling identified 2174 and 1354 high-confidence circRNAs in maize and Arabidopsis, respectively, and most were differentially expressed in response to drought. A substantial number of drought-associated circRNA hosting genes were involved in conserved or species-specific pathways in drought responses. Comparative analysis revealed that circRNA biogenesis was more complex in maize than in Arabidopsis. In most cases, maize circRNAs were negatively correlated with sRNA accumulation. In 368 maize inbred lines, the circRNA-hosting genes were enriched for SNPs associated with circRNA expression and drought tolerance, implying either important roles of circRNAs in maize drought responses or their potential use as biomarkers for breeding drought-tolerant maize. Additionally, the expression levels of circRNAs derived from drought-responsible genes encoding calcium-dependent protein kinase and cytokinin oxidase/dehydrogenase were significantly associated with drought tolerance of maize seedlings. Specifically, Arabidopsis plants overexpressing circGORK (Guard cell outward-rectifying K+-channel) were hypersensitive to ABA, but insensitive to drought, suggesting a positive role of circGORK in drought tolerance. We report the transcriptomic profiling and transgenic studies of circRNAs in plant drought responses, and provide evidences highlighting the universal molecular mechanisms involved in plant drought tolerance.
Overall design: RNA-seq and CircRNA-seq (RNaseR+) to Arabidopsis and maize plants under well-watered condition (WW) and drought treatments at various levels (DT2,DT3,DT4 and DT5 for Arabidopsis; DT2, DT3 and DT4 for Maize).

Overall design: For each structure-seq library, ~40 hydroponically grown Arabidopsis plants were used, which were dissected into shoot and root tissues. For the +DMS shoot sample, forty excised shoots from control or NaCl treatment were immersed in 20 mL DMS reaction buffer (40 mM HEPES (pH 7.5), 100 mM KCl, and 0.5 mM MgCl2) in a 50 mL conical centrifuge tube. Then 150 µl DMS (D186309, Sigma-Aldrich) was immediately added to the solution to a final concentration of 0.75% (~75 mM) for 5 min of DMS treatment, after which dithiothreitol (DTT) at a final concentration of 0.5 M was supplied to quench DMS in the reaction for 2 min followed by two washes with deionized water before immediate drying and freezing in liquid nitrogen. The −DMS sample was processed through the same procedure by placing materials in the DMS buffer for 20 min but without addition of DMS. Three independent biological replicates were prepared for both control and NaCl-treated shoot libraries, and for both −DMS and +DMS libraries, for a total of three −Salt−DMS libraries, three −Salt+DMS libraries, three +Salt−DMS libraries, and three +Salt+DMS libraries. All procedures for generation of root Structure-seq libraries were identical as for shoot library preparation, except that the initial material was the root tissue from forty plants each of control or NaCl treatment. Frozen samples were subjected to RNA extraction using the NucleoSpin RNA Plant kit (Cat# 740949, Macherey-Nagel, Germany) following the manufacturer’s protocol. Then the Structure-seq libraries were prepared according to the Structure-seq2 protocol, and starting with 300 ng total RNA. In total, 24 Structure-seq libraries were generated.

Our forward genetic screen disclosed the plant specific RNA polymerases IV and V in suppressing intronic TE-mediated cryptic transcription initiation of a chimeric transcripts at FLC (FLCTE). Initiation of FLCTE transcription is blocked by the locally formed intronic heterochromatin, and RNA Pol V direct associates and establishes intronic heterochromatin, thus inhibits the entry of RNA Pol II Ser5p and the occupancy of H3K4 methylation for promoting initiation. Genome-wide Pol II Ser5p native elongation transcription sequencing revealed that this is a common mechanism among intronic heterochromatin-containing genes.

PRJNA515943	Distinct characteristics of Arabidopsis thaliana circular RNAs (thale cress)	"In all living organisms, regulation of gene expression is fundamental for survival and adaptation. Gene expression can be modulated at various steps, including at the level of RNA processing. During the last few years, the importance of alternative splicing of mRNAs in controlling plant development and stress responses were emerged and highlighted its importance. Recently, an other type of alternative splicing has been reported which leads to the generation of circular RNAs (circRNAs), a novel class on endogenous noncoding RNAs. Several functions of circular RNAs have been proven or proposed, including functioning as microRNA or RNA-binding protein decoys, playing regulatory roles in gene expression or affecting transcriptional control via special RNA-RNA interactions. Despite the widening knowledge of circRNAs and their functional aspects in the animal kingdom, relatively little is known about circRNAs in plants.  In order to detect and classify circRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana, we created a workflow that includes generation of Illumina libraries enriched for circRNAs and a comparison of biocomputational tools developed for detecting endogenous circular RNAs in other species. With the power of high-throughput sequencing and evaluation of algorithms, high-fidelity candidates were subjected for an analysis of their functional role in plant development and stress-related responses,  especially regarding the role of splicing, including alternative splicing events, splice site preference and strength variances and transcript composition and to comprehend the role of RNA processing in stress response.  Here we present an approach combining bioinformatic tools and molecular techniques to investigate the adaptability of  detection methods of circRNAs from other species to plant circular RNAs, and based on our high-fidelity results  identify and understand the characteristics of circRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Overall design: In order to identify and analyze circRNAs in plants, Arabidopsis thaliana liquid culture seedlings were subjected for NGS RNA library preparation.

PRJNA516656	Arabidopsis thaliana FIBRILLIN6 is involved in acclimation to moderate light stress and cadmium tolerance (thale cress)	"By mining public co-expression databases, we have identified FBN6 as a photosynthesis-associated gene. FBN6 is located in thylakoids and plastoglobules, and its knock-out results in stunted plants characterized by slightly reduced chlorophyll contents, shorter roots and late flowering under long-day conditions. The delayed growth phenotype of fbn6-1 cannot be attributed to altered basic photosynthesis parameters or a reduced CO2 assimilation rate. FBN6 is also co-expressed with redox/ROS-associated genes, and we show that under moderate light stress, the primary leaves of fbn6 plants begin to bleach and contain enlarged plastoglobules. Furthermore, anthocyanin accumulation is reduced in fbn6 mutants. RNA-Seq and metabolomics analyses point to an altered sulfate assimilation leading to accumulation of reduced glutathione which in turn confers cadmium tolerance of fbn6 seedlings.

PRJNA517148	Deficiency in the Phosphorylated Pathway of Serine Biosynthesis perturbs sulfur assimilation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Although the plant Phosphorylated Pathway of L-serine Biosynthesis (PPSB) is essential for embryo and pollen development, and for root growth, its metabolic implications have not yet been investigated in depth. A transcriptomics analysis of PPSB-deficient mutants at nighttime, where PPSB activity is thought to be more important, pointed the sulfate assimilation process. As sulfate assimilation takes place mainly during the light period, we also investigated this process in PPSB-deficient lines in the daytime. Key genes in the sulfate starvation response, such as the Adenosine 5’phosphosulfate reductase (APR) genes along with sulfate transporters (SULTR), especially those involved in sulfate translocation in the plant, were induced in the PPSB-deficient lines. However, sulfate content did not lower in these lines, and the steady-state level of glutathione (GSH) increased in roots. This scenario suggests that PPSB deficiency perturbs the sulfate assimilation process between tissue/organs. Alteration of thiol distribution in leaves from different developmental stages, and between aerial parts and roots in plants with reduced PPSB activity provided confirmatory support for this idea. Flux analysis indicated that diminished PPSB activity caused an enhanced flux of 35S into thiol biosynthesis especially in roots. GSH turnover also accelerated in the PPSB-deficient lines, which supports the notion that not only biosynthesis, but also transport and allocation of thiols were perturbed in the PPSB mutants. Our results suggest that PPSB is required for sulfide assimilation in specific heterotrophic tissues and that lack of PPSB activity perturbs sulfur homeostasis between photosynthetic and non-photosynthetic tissues.

PRJNA517906	Comparison of transcriptomic responses to individual and combinatorial copper and iron deficiencies in Arabidopsis thaliana rosettes. (thale cress)	"Purpose: plants exposed to multiple simultaneous adverse growth conditions trigger molecular responses that differ from the sum of those to individual stressors. Copper and iron are fundamental elements required for proper photosynthesis, energy production, DNA metabolism and hormone sensing, among all. Therefore, copper and iron deprivation limits plant yield. In natural environments, simultaneous deficiency to copper and iron can occur. As part of a multiple high-throughput study to identify combinatorial responses to both copper and iron deficiency, RNA-Seq profiling of Arabidopsis thaliana rosette leaves exposed to copper and/or iron deficiencies have been conducted.
Methods: RNA-Seq libraries were prepared from total RNA of whole rosettes of 20-d-old plants treated for control conditions, copper deficiency, iron deficiency or simultaneous deficiency to both copper and iron for 10 d and sequenced using Illumina protocols. 2 independent plants were RNA-Seq-sequenced per treatment. Adaptor sequences were removed with Trimmomatic and the resulting reads mapped to the Arabidopsis genome (Araport11) with Tophat 2.1.1. Read counts and differential expression analysis were conducted with Cufflinks/Cuffdiff.
Results: for RNA-Seq analysis a Tophat/Cuffdiff pipeline was designed. Each sample provided app. 9 million reads. After applying a cut-off of absolute log2(FC) ≥ 1 to controls and a FDR ≤ 0.05, copper deficiency led to 83 differentially expressed genes, followed by 1708 during iron deficiency, while the combinatorial treatment altered 2056 transcripts. Comparison of differential expressed genes among treatments indicated that double deficiency led to app. 45% rewiring of all detected transcriptional changes.
Conclusions: our data support that combinatorial copper and iron deficiency treatments in plants triggers transcriptional responses that differ from those to single deficiencies.

PRJNA520905	Global co-transcriptional splicing in Arabidopsis and the correlation with splicing regulation in mature RNAs (thale cress)	"RNA splicing and spliceosome assembly in eukaryotes occur mainly during transcription. However, co-transcriptional splicing has not yet been explored in plants. Here, we showed that in Arabidopsis thaliana, nearly all introns undergo co-transcriptional splicing and this occurs with higher efficiency for introns in protein-coding genes than for noncoding RNAs. Co-transcriptional splicing efficiency correlates with density of 19 epigenetic modifications. Total intron number and intron position are two predominant sequence features that correlate with co-transcriptional splicing efficiency, and introns with alternative 5′ or 3′ splice sites are less efficiently spliced. Furthermore, we found that trans-acting protein mutations lead to more introns with increased splicing defects in nascent RNAs than in mature RNAs, and that introns with increased splicing defects in mature RNAs are inefficiently spliced at the co-transcriptional level. Our results not only uncovered widespread co-transcriptional splicing in Arabidopsis, but also uncovered features that may affect or be affected by co-transcriptional splicing efficiency.

PRJNA523174	Arabidopsis ECAP is a New Adaptor Protein that Connects JAZ Repressors with TPR2 Co-repressor to Suppress Jasmonate-Responsive Anthocyanin Accumulation (thale cress)	"Suppression mechanism employed by transcriptional repressors is commonly existed in diverse phytohormone signaling. In Arabidopsis thaliana, JASMONATE-ZIM DOMAIN (JAZ) proteins act as transcriptional repressors and involve in different aspects of the JA signaling network, through recruiting general co-repressors TOPLESS (TPL) and TPL-related proteins (TPRs). To accomplish overlapping but also finely separated functions of JAZ proteins, specificadaptor proteins are employed in JA signaling.

PRJNA523606	Genome-wide occupancy of Arabidopsis SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler SPLAYED provides insights into its interplay with its close homolog BRAHMA and Polycomb proteins (thale cress)	"SPLAYED (SYD) is a SWItch/Sucrose Non-Fermentable (SWI/SNF)-type chromatin remodeler identified in Arabidopsis thaliana (Arabidopsis). It is believed to play both redundant and differential roles with its closest homolog BRAHMA (BRM) in diverse plant growth and development processes. To better understand how SYD functions, we profiled the genome-wide occupancy of SYD and its impact on the global transcriptome and deposition of trimethylation of histone H3 on lysine 27 (H3K27me3). To map the global occupancy of SYD, we generated a GFP-tagged transgenic line and used it for ChIP-seq experiments, by which more than 6,000 SYD target genes were identified. Through integrating SYD occupancy and transcriptome profiles, we found that SYD preferentially targets to nucleosome-free regions of expressed genes. Further analysis revealed that SYD occupancy peaks exhibit five distinct patterns, which were also shared by BRM and BAF60, a conserved SWI/SNF complex component, indicating the common target sites of these SWI/SNF chromatin remodelers and the functional relevance of such distinct patterns. To investigate the interplay between SYD and Polycomb-group (PcG) proteins, we performed a genome-wide analysis of H3K27me3 in syd-5. We observed both increases and decreases in H3K27me3 levels at a few hundred genes in syd-5 compared to wild-type (WT). Our results imply that SYD can act antagonistically or synergistically with PcG at specific genes. Together, our SYD genome-wide occupancy data and the transcriptome and H3K27me3 profiles provide a much-needed resource for dissecting SYD’s crucial roles in the regulation of plant growth and development.

PRJNA523789	Inositol pyrophosphate InsP8 acts as intracellular phosphate signal in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The maintenance of cellular phosphate (Pi) homeostasis is of paramount importance in living organisms. Little is known about how cells sense intracellular Pi status in multi-cellular eukaryotes. Here, we report the identification of inositol pyrophosphate InsP8, a ligand that binds to the Pi sensor protein SPX1 to inhibit PHR1, the central regulator of Pi starvation responses in Arabidopsis. The concentration of InsP8, synthesized by diphosphoinositol pentakisphosphate kinases VIH1 and VIH2, depends on cellular Pi level and the double mutants accumulated higher amounts of Pi. The paradox of Pi toxicity and induction of Pi starvation inducible genes indicated that the cells could not sense cellular Pi without InsP8. Our study reveals that InsP8 acts as a Pi signaling molecule and binds to the receptor SPX1 to regulate Pi homeostasis.

PRJNA523801	Paternally-acting canonical RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway genes sensitizes Arabidopsis endosperm to paternal dosage [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Seed development is sensitive to parental dosage, with excess maternal or paternal  genomes creating reciprocal phenotypes. Paternal genomic excess results in extensive  endosperm proliferation without cellularization and eventual seed abortion. We  previously showed that loss of the RNA POL IV gene nrpd1 in tetraploid fathers  represses seed abortion in paternal excess crosses. Here we show genetically that  RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway activity in the paternal parent is  sufficient to determine the viability of paternal excess seeds. The status of the RdDM  pathway in paternal excess endosperm does not impact seed viability. Comparison of  endosperm transcriptomes, DNA methylation, and small RNAs from balanced and  paternal excess endosperm demonstrates that paternal excess seed abortion is unlikely  to be dependent on either transposable element or imprinted gene mis-regulation. We  suggest instead that loss of paternal RdDM modulates expression at a small subset of  genes and desensitizes endosperm to paternal excess. Finally, using allele-specific  transcription data, we present evidence of a transcriptional buffering system that up37  regulates maternal alleles and represses paternal alleles in response to excess paternal  genomic dosage. These findings prompt reconsideration of models for dosage  sensitivity in endosperm.
Overall design: Examination of parent-of-origin specific and total gene expression in wild type and nrpd1 endosperm 6 days after pollination - 10 samples.

PRJNA524135	The RNA NAD+ cap is widespread in the Arabidopsis transcriptome and probably promotes translation (thale cress)	"As the most common mRNA cap, the m7G cap impacts the fate of an mRNA in eukaryotes. The metabolite and redox agent, nicotinamide adenine diphosphate (NAD+), can be used as an initiating nucleotide in RNA synthesis to result in NAD+-capped RNAs. Such RNAs have been identified in bacteria, yeast, and human cells, but it is not known whether they exist in plant transcriptomes. The functions of the NAD+ cap in RNA metabolism or translation are still poorly understood. Here, through NAD captureSeq, we show that NAD+- capped RNAs are widespread in Arabidopsis thaliana. NAD+-capped RNAs are predominantly messenger RNAs encoded by the nuclear and mitochondrial genomes but not the chloroplast genome. NAD-capped transcripts from the nuclear genome appear to be spliced and polyadenylated. Furthermore, although NAD+-capped transcripts constitute a small proportion of the total transcript pool from any gene, they are enriched in the polysomal fraction and associate with translating ribosomes. Our findings implicate the existence of as yet unknown mechanisms of translation initiation on NAD+-capped mRNAs. More importantly, our findings suggest that cellular metabolic and/or redox states may influence, and maybe regulated by, mRNA NAD capping.
Overall design: We analyzed the NAD+-capped RNA in Arabidopsis seedling and inflorescence total RNA population, as well as NAD+- capped RNA in seedling polyA mRNA and polysomal RNA fraction.

PRJNA524697	Expression of a dominant‐negative AtNEET‐H89C protein disrupts iron–sulfur metabolism and iron homeostasis in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Iron–sulfur (Fe–S) clusters play an essential role in plants as protein cofactors mediating diverse electron transfer reactions. Because they can react with oxygen to form reactive oxygen species (ROS) and inflict cellular damage, the biogenesis of Fe–S clusters is highly regulated. A recently discovered group of 2Fe–2S proteins, termed NEET proteins, was proposed to coordinate Fe–S, Fe and ROS homeostasis in mammalian cells. Here we report that disrupting the function of AtNEET, the sole member of the NEET protein family in Arabidopsis thaliana, triggers leaf‐associated Fe–S‐ and Fe‐deficiency responses, elevated Fe content in chloroplasts (1.2–1.5‐fold), chlorosis, structural damage to chloroplasts and a high seedling mortality rate. Our findings suggest that disrupting AtNEET function disrupts the transfer of 2Fe–2S clusters from the chloroplastic 2Fe–2S biogenesis pathway to different cytosolic and chloroplastic Fe–S proteins, as well as to the cytosolic Fe–S biogenesis system, and that uncoupling this process triggers leaf‐associated Fe–S‐ and Fe‐deficiency responses that result in Fe over‐accumulation in chloroplasts and enhanced ROS accumulation. We further show that AtNEET transfers its 2Fe–2S clusters to DRE2, a key protein of the cytosolic Fe–S biogenesis system, and propose that the availability of 2Fe–2S clusters in the chloroplast and cytosol is linked to Fe homeostasis in plants.

PRJNA525282	NAD tagSeq, a new method for transcriptome-wide identification and quantification of NAD+-capped RNAs, revealed that NAD+-capped RNAs are produced from a large number of protein-coding genes in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The 5’ end of a eukaryotic mRNA generally has a methyl guanosine cap (m7G cap) that not only protects the mRNA from degradation but also mediates almost all other aspects of gene expression. Some RNAs in E. coli, yeast, and mammals were recently found to contain an NAD+ cap at their 5’ ends. Here we report development of a new method – NAD tagSeq – for transcriptome-wide identification and quantification of NAD+-capped RNAs (NAD-RNAs). The method uses first an enzymatic reaction and then a click chemistry reaction to label NAD-RNAs with a synthetic RNA tag. The tagged RNA molecules can be enriched and directly sequenced using the Oxford Nanopore sequencing technology. NAD tagSeq not only allows more accurate identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs but can also reveal sequences of whole NAD-RNA transcripts. Using NAD tagSeq, we found that NAD-RNAs in Arabidopsis are mostly produced from a few thousand protein-coding genes, with over 60% of them from fewer than 200 genes. The top 2,000 genes that were found to produce the highest numbers of NAD-RNAs were enriched in the gene ontology terms of responses to oxidative stress and other stresses, photosynthesis, and protein synthesis. For some Arabidopsis genes, over 10% of their transcripts could be NAD-capped. The NAD-RNAs in Arabidopsis have similar overall sequence structures to their canonical m7G-capped mRNAs. The identification and quantification of NAD-RNAs and revealing their sequence features provide essential steps toward understanding functions of NAD-RNAs.

PRJNA525303	Transcriptome responses to the natural phytotoxin t-chalcone in Arabidopsis thaliana L. (thale cress)	"BCKGROUND: New modes of action are needed for herbicides. The flavonoid synthesis intermediate t-chalcone causes apoptosis-like symptoms in roots and bleaching of shoots of Arabidospsis, suggesting a unique mode of action as a phytotoxin.
RESULTS: Using RNA-Seq, transcriptome changes were monitored in Arabidopsis seedlings during the first 24 h of exposure (at 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h) to 21 μM t-chalcone (I50 dose), examining effects on roots and shoots separately.  Expression of 892 and 1000 genes was affected in roots and shoots, respectively.  According to biological function, many of the affected genes were transcription factors and genes associated with oxidative stress, heat shock proteins, xenobiotic detoxification, ABA and auxin biosynthesis, and primary metabolic processess. These are secondary effects found with most phytotoxins. Potent phytotoxins usually act by inhibiting enzymes of primary metabolism. KEGG pathway analysis of transcriptome results from the first 3 h of t-chalcone expsoure indicated several potential primary metabolism target sites for t-chalcone. Of these, p-hydroxyphenylpyruvate dioxygenase (HPPD) and tyrosine amino transferase were consistent with the bleaching effect of the phytotoxin. Supplementation studies with Lemna paucicostata and Arabidiopsis supported HPPD as the target, although in vitro enzyme inhibition was not found.
CONCLUSIONS: t-Chalcone is possibly a protoxin that is converted to a HPPD inhibitor in vivo.
Overall design: Arabidopsis seedlings (14 days-old) were treated with t-chalcone at IC50 concentration (21 µM). After treatment, plants were incubated for 0, 1, 3, 6, 12 and 24 h.

PRJNA525432	Transcriptome analysis using RNA sequencing conducted for wild type (Col-0) and a stable transgenic line with ectopic expression of AT3G11290 (35S:HIN1) under control conditions and after 96 hours at moderate low water potential stress (-0.7 MPa) (thale cress)	"RNA sequencing was used to identify alternative splicing events and differentially expressed genes (DEG) in 35S:HIN1 stable transgenic line compared to Col-0 wild type. Two treatments were analyzed for each genotype: unstressed control and a 96 hours moderate severity low water potential (-0.7 MPa) treatment. RNA sequencing analysis found that overexpression of HIN1 in unstressed plants was sufficient to duplicate the effects of stress on nearly 40% of the genes where intron retention was normally suppressed by stress in wild type. Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were also analyzed (P < 0.05 and fold change ≥ 1.5 used as cut off values for DEGs). Differentially expressed genes in 35S:HIN1has limited overlap of DEGs between 35S:HIN1and wild type. This indicated that HIN1 plays a lesser role in stress-regulated gene expression than in splicing regulation.
Overall design: Wild type (Col-0) and 35S:HIN1 stable transgenic line Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings were germinated on half strength Murashige-Skoog agar plates. After seven days of growth, seedlings were transferred either to fresh plates of control media or to moderate low water potential (-0.7 MPa) imposed using agar plates of the control media infiltrated with PEG-8000. Samples were collected 96 hours after transfer to unstressed control and stress treatments. Three independent biological experiments and RNA extractions were performed for each genotype/treatment.

PRJNA525997	NRP histone chaperones promote the removal of histone variant H2A.Z (thale cress)	"In eukaryotes, DNA wraps around histones to form nucleosomes, which are compacted into chromatin. DNA-templated processes, including transcription, require chromatin disassembly and reassembly mediated by histone chaperones. Additionally, distinct histone variants can replace core histones to regulate chromatin structure and function. Although replacement of H2A with the evolutionarily conserved H2A.Z via the SWR1 histone chaperone complex has been extensively studied, in plants little is known about how a reduction of H2A.Z levels can be achieved in plants. Here, we show that NRP proteins cause a decrease of H2A.Z-containing nucleosomes in Arabidopsis under standard growing conditions. nrp1-1 nrp2-2 double mutants show an over-accumulation of H2A.Z genome-wide, especially at heterochromatic regions normally H2A.Z-depleted in wild-type plants. Our work suggests that NRP proteins regulate gene expression by counteracting SWR1, thereby preventing excessive accumulation of H2A.Z.
Overall design: In Arabidopsis, NRP proteins have been implicated in several biological processes, including cell-cycle control, root meristem formation, heat tolerance, DNA repair, somatic homologous recombination, and genome defense under genotoxic stress. NRP proteins are localized mainly in the nucleus and bind H2A, H2B, H3, and H4 histones. However, a molecular mechanism for these proteins has not been clearly established. Less..."

PRJNA526012	The poly(A) polymerase PAPS1 interacts with the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway in sporophyte and pollen development [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"RNA-based processes play key roles in the regulation of eukaryotic gene expression. This includes both the processing of pre-mRNAs into mature mRNAs ready for translation and RNA-based silencing processes, such as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). Polyadenylation of pre-mRNAs is one important step in their processing and is carried out by three functionally specialized canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerases in Arabidopsis thaliana. Null-mutations in one of these, termed PAPS1, result in a male gametophytic defect. Using a fluorescence-labelling strategy, we have characterized this defect in more detail using RNA and small-RNA sequencing. In addition to global defects in expression of pollen-differentiation genes, paps1 null mutant pollen show a strong overaccumulation of transposable-element transcripts, yet a depletion of 21- and particularly 24-nucleotide long short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) targeting the corresponding transposable elements. Double-mutant analyses support a specific functional interaction between PAPS1 and components of the RdDM pathway, as evident from strong synergistic phenotypes in mutant combinations involving paps1, but not paps2 paps4 mutations. In particular, the double mutant of paps1 and rna-dependent rna polymerase 6 (rdr6) shows a synergistic developmental phenotype disrupting the formation of the transmitting tract in the female gynoecium. Thus, our findings in A. Thaliana uncover a potentially general link between canonical poly(A) polymerases as components of mRNA processing and RdDM, reflecting an analogous interaction in fission yeast.

PRJNA526623	Cadmium interference with iron sensing reveals transcriptional programs sensitive and insensitive to reactive oxygen species (thale cress)	"Iron (Fe) is an essential micronutrient whose uptake is tightly regulated to balance both deficiency and Fe excess induced oxidative stress. The non-essential heavy metal cadmium (Cd) both induces oxidative stress and an Fe deficiency like response.  It is unclear how Cd induces this response, nor how it relates to Fe status sensing.  Using next generation sequencing, H2O2 quantification in both wild type and the Fe over-accumulating mutant opt3-2, we explored how Cd interferes with Fe sensing.  We found a large overlap of genes consistently responsive to Fe deficiency and Cd in both leaves and roots.  Two subnetworks emerged dependent on the high Fe and H2O2 concentration in opt3-2, while opt3-2 chloroplasts showed reduced photosynthetic efficiency during Cd exposure, indicating that they are one source of H2O2.  We describe the hierarchical regulation of Fe deficiency responses in the context of the opt3-2 mutant, and demonstrate that the opt3 dependent induction of Fe deficiency responses can be negated, or even reversed, by H2O2 dependent signaling, while the high Fe content of opt3-2 indicates Cd induced iron deficiency is not a function of reduced Fe uptake, but rather the putative leaf Fe sensor is Cd liable.

Here, we characterize chromatin accessibility, histone modifications and sequence conservation in 13 plant species. We identified thousands of putative CREs and revealed that distal CREs are prevalent in plants especially in species with large and complex genomes. The majority of distal CREs have been moved away from their target genes by transposable element (TE) proliferation, but a significant number of distal CREs also appear to be created by TEs. Finally, plant distal CREs are associated with three major types of chromatin signatures that are distinct from metazoans. Taken together, these results suggest that CREs are prevalent in plants, highly dynamic during evolution, and function with distinct chromatin pathways to regulate gene expression.

PRJNA528286	Wide spread and efficient co-transcriptional splicing facilitated by multiple exons (thale cress)	"Pre-mRNA splicing is important for gene expression in most eukaryotic organisms. Regulation occurs during pre-mRNA splicing greatly expanded the transcriptome complexity. Recent studies from Mammals, Drosophila and Yeast showed that the majority of introns are spliced co-transcriptionally. However, in plant the nature of co-transcriptionally splicing (CTS) and its regulation is still largely unknown. Here, through sequencing the chromatin-bound RNA (CB-RNA-seq), we studied the feature of CTS in Arabidopsis. We found CTS is widespread in Arabidopsis seedlings and a large proportion of alternative splicing events are determined co-transcriptionally. We found the CTS efficiency correlate with gene expression level, chromatin landscape and most surprisingly, the number of intron/exon of individual genes, whilst independent of gene length.  In combination with iCLIP analysis, we found splicing regulator RZ-1B/1C promotes efficient CTS of thousands genes involving direct binding mainly to the exonic sequences. Interestingly, for many cases, the splicing promotion activity of RZ-1C does not associate with its binding to the regions immediately adjacent to the regulated intron. We propose a model of plant gene splicing, where multiple exon of individual gene is in favour of efficient CTS likely involving RZ-1C cooperative interactions with many exons and splicing factors. Our work uncovers the robustness of plant CTS and highlighted the role of RZ-1C in this process.

PRJNA528518	Immediate transcriptional responses to heat shock of plant leaf (thale cress)	"Ambient temperature is one of the most important environment factors that direct all organisms for morphogenesis, metabolisms and growth. Plants have evolved efficient mechanisms adapting temperature fluctuation such as heat stress response (HSR). Although transcriptional regulatory network of plant HSR has been established, little is known on the genome-wide transcriptional changes within first several minutes upon heat shock (HS). To precisely measure the very first wave of transcriptional response to HS, we investigated the nascent RNA and mature mRNA from plant leaf tissue exposure to 5-min HS treatment using global run-on sequencing (GRO-seq) and RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods. We found that only a small group of genes were both up- or down-regulated at nascent RNA and mRNA levels. Primed plants that already exposed to a mild heat stress induced a more drastic transcriptomic alteration than naïve plants which had not experienced a heat stress. Group A1 HEAT SHOCK TRANSCRIPTION FACTORs (HsfA1s) are the major transcription factors in charge of the very early transcriptional HSR. Within 5-minute HS, we also observed that: 1) Engaged RNA polymerase II (Pol II) was accumulated downstream of transcription start sites; 2) 5' pause-release is a rate limiting step for induction of some heat shock protein genes; 3) A good number of genes switched transcription modes; 4) Pervasive read-through was induced at terminators. Plants' HSR is transcriptionally very quick. GRO-seq is sensitive and robust to detect quick response to HS. Heat stress memory takes place at multiple steps of transcription cycles such as Pol II recruitment, 5' pausing, elongation and termination.

WUS expresses in organizing center and its protein moves upward to stem cells to activate CLV3 expressions. Only a few target genes of WUS were reported which involved in stem cell maintenance. To indentify new targets of WUS, we performed RNA high throughput sequencing after inducing WUS activity with DEX (dexamethasone) and CHX (Cycloheximide).

PRJNA529202	Transcription and export complex (THO/TREX) coordinates transcription termination in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Transcription termination of mRNAs transcribed from a given locus has a decisive role in regulating the gene function as it determines the coding potential and inclusion of regulatory sequence elements. Failure in appropriate transcription termination leads to read-through transcription, resulting in the synthesis of antisense RNAs which can have profound impact on overall gene expression. However, molecular mechanisms which regulate transcription termination and chimeric RNA formation are poorly understood.   We explored the regulatory function of transcription and export complex (THO/TREX) in transcription termination. We show that two members of THO/TREX complex, TREX COMPONENT 1 (TEX1) and HYPER RECOMBINATION1(HPR1) are critical for the correct transcription termination in Arabidopsis. We first demonstrate this by showing defective termination of the bacterial nopaline synthase (NOS) terminator on a transgene in tex1 and hpr1 mutants. Additionally, we show that RNA termination defects in tex1 and hpr1 mutants are widespread at the whole genome levels leading to 3’UTR extensions, truncations and in some cases in the formation of intergenic chimeric transcripts. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with quantitative PCR experiments confirmed the presence of RNA polymerase II beyond the canonical termination sites on genes with defective RNA termination in tex1 and hpr1 mutants. These results demonstrate that THO/TREX complex is a novel regulator of transcription termination in Arabidopsis.

Arabidopsis ddm1 mutants produce LTR retrotransposon transcripts that are processed into 21-22 nt easiRNAs by RNA-Dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6). To test if 21-22 nt easiRNAs regulate transcription, translation and reverse transcription of LTR retrotransposons, we compared ddm1 and ddm1rdr6 in polysomal RNAseq, VLP DNAseq and ChIPseq data. We found a handful of ATHILA elements were differentially regulated in ddm1rdr6 for polysomal RNAseq, VLP DNAseq, and ChIPseq datasets.

PRJNA529456	The AP2/ERF Transcription Factor TINY Modulates Brassinosteroid-Regulated Plant Growth and Drought Response in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The functions of AP2/ERF family transcription factors in stress responses are well documented, but their roles in the brassinosteroid (BR)-regulated growth and stress responses have not been established. Here we show that stress-inducible AP2/ERF family transcription factor TINY inhibits BR-regulated growth while promoting drought response. TINY overexpression plants have stunted growth, increased sensitivity to BR biosynthesis inhibitors and compromised BR-responsive gene expression. In contrast, a tiny tiny2 tiny3 triple mutant has increased BR-regulated growth and BR-responsive gene expression. TINY positively regulates drought response by activating drought responsive genes and promoting abscisic acid-mediated stomatal closure. Global gene expression studies revealed that TINY and BRs oppositely regulate genes involved in plant growth and stress response. TINY interacts with and antagonizes BES1 in the regulation of these genes. The GSK3-like protein kinase BIN2, a negative regulator in the BR pathway, phosphorylates and stabilizes TINY, providing a mechanism for BR-mediated down-regulation of TINY to prevent activation of stress response under optimal growth conditions. Taken together, our results demonstrate that TINY is negatively regulated by BR signaling through BIN2 phosphorylation and positively regulates drought response, as well as inhibits BR-mediated plant growth through TINY-BES1 antagonistic interactions. Our results thus provide insight into the coordination of BR-regulated growth and drought responses.
Overall design: For RNA sequencing analysis, total RNA was extracted from four-week-old long day grown plants using Zymo DirecZol kit (ZYMO RESEARCH). RNA concentrations and quality were analyzed using AATI Fragment Analyzer with Standard Sensitivity RNA Analysis Kit (DNF-489-0500).

PRJNA529478	PRX2 and PRX25, peroxidases regulated by COG1, are involved in seed longevity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Permeability is a crucial trait that affects seed longevity and is regulated by different polymers including proanthocyanidins, suberin, cutin and lignin located in the seed coat. By testing mutants in suberin transport and biosynthesis, we demonstrate the importance of this biopolymer to cope with seed deterioration. Transcriptomic analysis of cog1‐2D, a gain‐of‐function mutant with increased seed longevity, revealed the upregulation of several peroxidase genes. Reverse genetics analysing seed longevity uncovered redundancy within the seed coat peroxidase gene family, however after controlled deterioration treatment, seeds from the prx2 prx25 double and prx2 prx25 prx71 triple mutant plants presented lower germination than wild‐type plants. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) analysis of the seed coat of these mutants showed a thinner palisade layer, but no changes were observed in proanthocyanidin accumulation or in the cuticle layer. Spectrophotometric quantification of acetyl bromide‐soluble lignin components indicated changes in the amount of total polyphenolics derived from suberin and/or lignin in the mutant seeds. Finally, the increased seed coat permeability to tetrazolium salts observed in the prx2 prx25 and prx2 prx25 prx71 mutant lines suggested that the lower permeability of the seed coats caused by altered polyphenolics is likely to be the main reason explaining their reduced seed longevity.

The non-mammalian enzyme is a key component in the plant sphingolipid biosynthetic pathway and is shown here to be a possible herbicide target.  RNA-Seq analyses demonstrated that over-expression of inositol phosphorylceramide synthase isoforms AtIPCS1, 2 or 3 in Arabidopsis thaliana resulted in the down-regulation of genes involved in plant response to pathogens. In addition, genes associated with the abiotic stress response to salinity, cold and drought were found to be similarly down-regulated. Detailed analyses of transgenic lines over-expressing AtIPCS1-3 at various levels revealed that the degree of down-regulation is specifically correlated with the level of IPCS expression. Singular enrichment analysis of these down-regulated genes showed that AtIPCS1-3 expression affects biological signaling pathways involved in plant response to biotic and abiotic stress. The up-regulation of genes involved in photosynthesis and lipid localization was also observed in the over-expressing lines.

PRJNA530416	Phloem-related genes are downregulated during radial growth of smxl4 smxl5 double mutant stems (thale cress)	"As a prerequisite for constant growth, plants can produce vascular tissues at different sites in their postembryonic body. In particular, the formation of vascular tissues during longitudinal and radial expansion of growth axes differs fundamentally with respect to its anatomical configuration. This raises the question to which level regulatory mechanisms of vascular tissue formation are shared throughout plant development. Here, we show that, similar as primary phloem formation during longitudinal growth, the cambium-based formation of secondary phloem depends on the function of SMXL genes. Using promoter reporter lines, we observe that SMXL4 and SMXL5 activities are associated with different stages of secondary phloem formation in Arabidopsis stems and that specific loss of SMXL5 function results in the absence of secondary phloem. Interestingly, the additional disruption of SMXL4 activity increases cell proliferation rates in the cambium region without forming secondary phloem. Based on genome-wide transcriptional profiling and expression analyses of phloem-related markers we conclude that early steps of phloem formation are impaired in smxl4;smxl5 double mutants and that additional cambium-derived cells fail in establishing any phloem-related feature. Our results show that molecular mechanisms determining primary and secondary phloem share important features but differ slightly with SMXL5 playing a more dominant role in the formation of secondary phloem.

In addition, a 4th P regimen designated ‘Low+P’ was created by adding additional P to a set of pots with low P. The amount of P added to these pots is based on the difference in total P between Low and High P plots. The average difference between Low and High P over all the plots is 42 mg P per kg soil [41]. Per pot, this is 12.6 mg P (accounting for 300 g soil per pot).

PRJNA531657	Transcript isoform sequencing reveals widespread promoter-proximal transcriptional termination in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"RNA polymerase II (RNAPII) transcription converts the DNA sequence of a single gene into multiple transcript isoforms that may carry alternative functions. Gene isoforms result from variable transcription start sites (TSSs) at the beginning and polyadenylation sites (PASs) at the end of transcripts. How alternative TSSs relate to variable PASs is poorly understood. Here, we identify both ends of RNA molecules in Arabidopsis thaliana by transcription isoform sequencing (TIF-seq) and report four transcript isoforms per expressed gene. While intragenic initiation represents a large source of regulated isoform diversity, we observe that ~14% of expressed genes generate relatively unstable short promoter-proximal RNAs (sppRNAs) from nascent transcript cleavage and polyadenylation shortly after initiation. The location of sppRNAs correlates with the position of promoter-proximal RNAPII stalling, indicating that large pools of promoter-stalled RNAPII may engage in transcriptional termination. We propose that promoter-proximal RNAPII stalling-linked to premature transcriptional termination may represent a checkpoint that governs plant gene expression.
Overall design: TIF-Seq was used to simultaneously map the transcription initiation sites and termination sites on A.thaliana seedlings (Col-0,Col-0 cold treated, HEN2-deficient genotype, HEN2-deficient cold treated and FACT-deficient genotypes).

In genomes uncoupled (gun) mutants, LHCB1.2 expression is maintained in the presence of LIN or other inhibitors of early chloroplast development. In a screen using concentrations of LIN lower than those employed to isolate gun mutants, we have identified happy on lincomycin (holi) mutants. Several holi mutants show increased tolerance to LIN, exhibiting de-repressed LHCB1.2 expression and chlorophyll synthesis in seedlings. The mutations responsible were identified by whole-genome SNP mapping, and most were found to affect the phenylpropanoid pathway. However, LHCB1.2 expression appears not to be directly regulated by phenylpropanoids, as indicated by metabolic profiling of mutants. The most potent holi mutant is defective in a subunit of cellulose synthase encoded by IRREGULAR XYLEM3, and comparative analysis of this and other cell-wall mutants establishes a link between secondary cell-wall integrity and tolerance to LIN, possibly involving altered ABA metabolism or sensing.

The molecular mechanism underlying this phenomena is still unknown. In silico and RT-qPCR analysis revealed increased expression of genes involved in auxin synthesis, hydrolysis, transport, and metabolism, which are supported by elevated auxin levels both in-vitro and in-vivo, and by assays demonstrating their effect on epidermal cell elongation in the AtMIOX4 over-expresser. Additionally, we detected upregulation of transcripts involved in photosynthesis and in support to this finding, the transgenic plants displayed increased efficiency of the photosystem II and proton motive force. We also found increased expression of amylase leading to higher intracellular glucose levels. Multiple gene families conferring plants tolerance to cold, water limitation, and heat stresses were found to be elevated in the MIOX4 line. Interestingly, the high AsA plants also displayed upregulation of transcripts and hormones involved in defense including jasmonates, defensin, glucosinolates, and transcription factors that are known to be important for biotic stress tolerance. These results overall indicate that elevated auxin and glucose, enhanced phosynthetic efficiency in combination with up-regulation of abiotic stresses response genes are some of the reasons that explain the higher growth rate and abiotic stresses tolerance phenotype of the AtMIOX4 over-expressers.

PRJDB3784	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Comparative transcriptome analysis of diploid and tetraploid Arabidopsis	"Autopolyploidy has been utilized for improvements of crops, fruits, ornamental flowers, because high polyploidy often give organisms larger statue, higher accumulation of chemicals and stronger tolerance against various stresses. In spite of the above fact, autopolyploids have been reported to have no or very limited changes in transcriptome profiles in comparison with their diploid parents.
Typically, in a model plant species, Arabidopsis thaliana (L.) Heynh. (Arabidopsis), no reproducible changes among accessions was detected between transcriptomes of diploids and tetraploids.
In this project, in order to examine if tetraploidization really unlinked to alterations in transcriptional regulations, we deep-sequenced cDNAs of diploid and tetraploid shoots of Arabidopsis. Less..."	
PRJDB5125	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Double-stranded RNA-binding protein DRB3 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by modulating PAP1 expression in Arabidopsis thaliana	The model plant Arabidopsis thaliana has five double-stranded RNA-binding proteins (DRB1-DRB5), two of which, DRB1 and DRB4, are well characterized. In contrast, the functions of DRB2, DRB3 and DRB5 have yet to be elucidated. In this study, we tried to uncover their functions using drb mutants and DRB-over-expressed lines. In over-expressed lines of all five DRB genes, the over-expression of DRB2 or DRB3 (DRB2ox or DRB3ox) conferred a downward-curled leaf phenotype, but the expression profiles of 10 small RNAs were similar to that of the wild-type (WT) plant. Phenotypes were examined in response to abiotic stresses. Both DRB2ox and DRB3ox plants exhibited salt-tolerance. When these plants were exposed to cold stress, drb2 and drb3 over-accumulated anthocyanin but DRB2ox and DRB3ox did not. Therefore, the over-expression of DRB2 or DRB3 had pleiotropic effects on host plants. Microarray and deep-sequencing analyses indicated that several genes encoding key enzymes for anthocyanin biosynthesis, including chalcone synthase (CHS), dihydroflavonol reductase (DFR) and anthocyanidin synthase (ANS), were down-regulated in DRB3ox plants. When DRB3ox was crossed with the pap1-D line, which is an activation-tagged transgenic line that over-expresses the key transcription factor PAP1 (Production of anthocyanin pigmentation1) for anthocyanin biosynthesis, over-expression of DRB3 suppressed the expression of PAP1, CHS, DFR and ANS genes. DRB3 negatively regulates anthocyanin biosynthesis by modulating the level of PAP1 transcript. Since two different small RNAs regulate PAP1 gene expression, a possible function of DRB3 for small RNA biogenesis is discussed. Less...

Consequently, protein isoforms with different N-termini are produced to display light-dependent localization changes, preferentially between plastids and cytoplasm. Less...

PRJEB24873	Effects of FT on FD during the transition to flowering at the SAM in Arabidopsis thaliana	The transition to flowering is a crucial step in the plant life cycle that is controlled by multiple endogenous and environmental cues, including hormones, sugars, temperature, and photoperiod. Permissive photoperiod induces FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) in the phloem companion cells of leaves. The FT protein then acts as a florigen that is transported to the shoot apical meristem (SAM) where it physically interacts with the bZIP transcription factor FD and 14-3-3 proteins. However, despite the importance of FD for promoting flowering, its direct transcriptional targets are largely unknown. Here we applied ChIP-seq and RNA-seq to identify targets of FD at the genome scale and assess the contribution of FT to binding DNA. We further investigated the ability of FD to form protein complexes with FT and TFL1 through the interaction with 14-3-3 proteins. Importantly, we observe direct binding of FD to targets involved in the jasmonate signaling pathway, which so far had not been directly linked to the regulation of flowering time. Our study confirms FD as central regulator of the floral transition at the shoot meristem and provides evidence for crosstalk between the regulation of flowering and jasmonate signaling. Less...	
PRJEB20420	Small RNA and mRNA-seq of Arabidopsis thaliana WT and hyl1-2 seedlings in light or dark.Small RNA and mRNA sequencing Arabidopsis thaliana WT and hyl1-2 seedlings in light or dark illumination conditions.	Light is the most influential and essential environment stimuli for a plant growth. As a response to a deficient light source plants re-program their developmental programs to adjust their growth in search for a light source. Such adaptive trait is orchestrated by a fine equilibrium of gene expression. Here, we shown that plants rely on a massive shutdown of microRNAs (miRNAs) biogenesis during long dark deprivation followed by a quick recovery after light restoration to accomplish a proper response to dark-light transition. In order to achieve such response the miRNA biogenesis factor HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) is actively degraded during light deprivation in the cell cytoplasm while an inactive pool of phosphorylated protein remains protected inside the nucleus. Upon light restoration a quick dephosphorylation of the HYL1 reserve pool lead to the reactivation of miRNA biogenesis and de-etiolation response. Our findings thus define an unexpected massive regulatory phenomenon involving the plant silencing machinery during plant light response. Less...

PRJEB26953	Epigenetic basis of transgenerational immune priming in ArabidopsisWe identified four epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTL) providing heritable resistance without negative consequences for plant growth or resistance to different (a)biotic stresses. Our study provides proof-of-concept that modification of plant DNA methylation can yield heritable disease resistance without major non-target effects.	DNA methylation in plants transmits trans-generational epigenetic information, which affects diverse traits independently of genetic variation. Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation regulates priming of plant immunity, which increases the responsiveness of plant immune system resulting in enhanced resistance to pathogens. In this study, we screened an Arabidopsis population of epigenetic recombinant inbred lines (epiRILs) for disease resistance against Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa). We identified four epigenetic quantitative trait loci (epiQTL) providing heritable resistance without negative consequences for plant growth or resistance to different (a)biotic stresses. RNA-sequencing analysis of Hpa-resistant epiRILs revealed the resistance is based on genome-wide priming of defence-related genes, providing first causal evidence for the role of DNA methylation in defence priming. Through analysis of DNA methylation and chromatin interactions at the epiQTLs, we propose a novel trans-regulatory mechanism by which methylation-sensitive chromatin interactions contribute to transgenerational immune priming. Our study provides proof-of-concept that modification of plant DNA methylation can yield heritable disease resistance without major non-target effects. Less...

PRJEB27682	WGBS and RNA-seq of A. thaliana plants subjected to mild dorughtMild drought induces phenotypic and DNA methylation plasticity but no transgenerational effect in Arabidopsis	Whether environmentally-induced changes in phenotypes can be heritable is a topic with revived interest, in part because of observations in plants that heritable trait variation can occur without DNA sequence mutations. This other system of inheritance, called transgenerational epigenetics, typically involves differences in DNA methylation that are stable across multiple generations. However, it remains unknown if such a system responds to environmental changes and if it could therefore provide a rapid way for plants to generate adaptive heritable phenotypic variation. Here, we used a well-controlled phenotyping platform and whole-genome bisulfite sequencing to investigate potential heritable effects of mild drought applied over two successive generations in Arabidopsis thaliana. Although phenotypic responses were observed in plants exposed to drought, progeny of stressed and non-stressed plants were phenotypically indistinguishable, except for parental effects, and irrespective of whether they were grown in control conditions or under water deficit. Moreover, while mild drought induced changes to the DNA methylome of exposed plants, DNA methylation variants were not inherited. These findings add to the growing body of evidence indicating that transgenerational epigenetics is not a common response of plants to environmental changes. Less...

RNA-seq of double mutants: med14-3 or uvh6-3 combined with either ddm1-2 or mom1-2 mutants. Bisulfite-seq of WT samples subjected to control or heat stress. Bisulfite-seq of med14-3 and WT samples in control stress.	Heterochromatin transcription is functionally important, for instance to establish heterochromatin silencing or condensation, but the factors allowing transcription in a repressive chromatin environment are little known. To gain insight in this process, we triggered heterochromatin transcription using heat stress or mutations for the silencing factors DDM1 or MOM1 and generated mRNA profiles of med14 and uvh6 mutants in these different contexts. We used rosette leaves incubated 24h in dH2O at 23°C for control stress and 37°C for heat stress. Our data and analysis suggest that UVH6/XPD/RAD3 is involved in a heat stress specific transcriptional process where it promotes transcription of most but not all genes. MED14 promotes transcription at a more reduced number of loci during heat stress, and preferentially targets heterochromatic loci. In addition, MED14 is required for heterochromatin transcription without heat stress, but this function is lost when heterochromatin properties are disrupted, suggesting it is specifically involved in transcription of heterochromatic sequences. In addition, bisulfite-seq of med14 mutants indicates that MED14 participates in RNA-directed DNA methylation, suggesting that MED14 is required both for heterochromatin transcription and formation.

PRJEB25745	Transcriptome analysis of Arabidopsis siliquesTranscriptome analysis of Arabidopsis siliques reveals genes with essential roles in fruit development and maturation	Fruits protect the developing seeds and actively contribute to seed dispersion. Furthermore, fruit and seed development are highly synchronized and require exchange of information between the mother plant and the developing generations. To explore the mechanisms controlling fruit formation and maturation, we performed a transcriptomic analysis on the valve tissue of the Arabidopsis thaliana silique, using the RNAseq strategy. In doing so, we have generated a dataset of differentially regulated genes that will help to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that underpin the initial phase of fruit growth, and subsequently trigger fruit maturation. The robustness of our dataset has been tested by functional genomic studies. Using a reverse genetics approach, we selected 10 differentially expressed genes and explored the consequences of their disruption for both silique growth and senescence. We found that genes contained in our dataset play essential roles in different stages of silique development and maturation, indicating that our transcriptome-based gene list is a powerful tool for the elucidation of the molecular mechanisms controlling fruit formation in Arabidopsis thaliana.

PRJEB29530	Salicylic acid-induced gene expression in wild-type Col-0 and mutant upl3-4 Arabidopsis thaliana plants.	Activation of plant immunity is associated with dramatic transcriptome reprogramming to prioritise immune responses over normal cellular functions. Changes in gene expression are coordinated by the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA). Here we investigated the involvement of the HECT-type ligase Ubiquitin Protein Ligase 3 (UPL3) in SA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. We show that UPL3 acts as an amplifier of SA-induced changes in gene expression.  Four-week old Arabidopsis thaliana plants of wild-type Col-0 and mutant upl3-4 genotypes were germinated on soil in 100% relative humidity. After 12 days plants were transplanted to larger pots (six plants per pot) and grown for an additional 3 weeks before experimental treatment. Plants were continuously grown in an environmental chamber with 16/8 hour day/night light regime (120 mol m-2 s-1 light intensity), 21/18 degrees celcius day/night cycle and 65% relative humidity. Plants were then sprayed with water or 0.5 mM SA until all leaves were thoroughly covered with fine droplets. After 24 hours leaf tissue was harvested from 6 plants per treatment and pooled together into a single biological repeat. In total two or three independent biological repeats were collected.  After harvesting leaf tissue was immediately frozen in liquid nitrogen until further analysis. Less...

Changes in gene expression are coordinated by the immune hormone salicylic acid (SA). Here we investigated the involvement of the E4 ubiquitin ligase UBE4/MUSE3 in SA-induced transcriptional reprogramming. We show that loss of UBE4 function results in amplified expression of SA-induced, NPR1-dependent gene expression.  Twelve-day old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings of wild-type Col-0, mutant ube4 (SAIL_713_A12) and mutant npr1-1 genotypes were grown on MS media supplemented with 1X Gamborg vitamins in an environmental chamber with 16/8 hour day/night light regime (120 mol m-2 s-1 light intensity) and 22 degrees Celcius. Seedlings were then transferred to 6-well plates and immersed in 10 ml of 0.5 mM SA or water.

PRJEB31094	Transcriptional Response of Arabidopsis thaliana to Fluctuating Light	"Natural-light environments are highly variable. Flexible adjustment between light energy utilization and photoprotection is therefore of vital importance for plant performance and fitness in the field. Short-term reactions to changing light intensity are triggered inside chloroplasts and leaves within seconds to minutes, whereas long-term adjustments proceed over hours and days, integrating multiple signals. While the mechanisms of long-term acclimation to light intensity have been studied by changing constant growth light intensity during the day, responses to fluctuating growth light intensity have rarely been inspected in detail. We performed transcriptome profiling in Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana) leaves to investigate long-term gene expression responses to fluctuating light (FL). In particular, we examined whether responses differ between young and mature leaves or between morning and at the end of the day. 

Samples / runs are named according to the following scheme: [CS][EM][48]_X-Y, where C = constant light, S = fluctuating light, E = sampled in the evening, M = sampled in the morning, 4 or 8 refers to sampling the 4th (young) or 8th (old) leaf, X is the biological replicate, and only for runs, Y is the technical replicate.

PRJEB28610	Small RNA and mRNA sequencing in Arabidopsis thaliana under different temperatures to study miRNA biogenesis.In Arabidopsis thaliana, the dependence of some miRNA on biogenesis cofactors for its production, such as HYL1, is conditioned by the plant growth temperature. The levels of some miRNA are low in hyl1 mutants grown at 22ºC, but are restored under 16ºC in the same mutant plants.	In regular growth chamber conditions (22-23 °C, long-day photoperiod) miRNAs are produced by the catalytic action of the type II ribonuclease DICER LIKE 1 (DCL1). During this reaction HYPONASTIC LEAVES 1 (HYL1) and SERRATE (SE) are necessary for the accurate excision of the miRNAs from their long and complex primary transcripts. Once produced, miRNAs are methylated by HEN1 and loaded into ARGONAUTE 1 (AGO1) to carry out their regulatory functions. Mutations in the genes that encode these proteins have severe consequences for miRNAs production/stability, plant homeostasis and phenotypic traits. In our lab, we observed that plants with mutations in DCL1-cofactors HYL1 and SE showed an attenuated phenotype and increased fertility, as measured by seed production, embryonic abortion and pollen viability, when grown at 16 ºC, compared to 23 ºC grown plants. These phenomena were not evidenced in mutants affecting proteins downstream of the core miRNA-biogenesis, suggesting that such effects caused by lowering the temperature are produced during the initial steps of miRNA biogenesis. We found that there are temperature responsive-, not responsive- and HYL1 independent miRNAs, which we categorized with a small RNA sequencing of Col-0 and hyl1-2 plants grown at 23 °C and 16 °C.

PRJEB31496	RNAseq analysis of Arabidopsis cell suspension culture treated with IAA, RN3 and RN4	Auxin phytohormones control most aspects of plant development through a complex and interconnected signaling network. In the presence of auxin, AUXIN/INDOLE-3-ACETIC ACID (AUX/IAA) transcriptional repressors are targeted for degradation by the SKP1-CULLIN1-F-BOX (SCF) ubiquitin-protein ligases containing TRANSPORT INHIBITOR RESISTANT 1/AUXIN SIGNALING F-BOX (TIR1/AFB). CULLIN1-neddylation is required for SCFTIR1/AFB functionality as exemplified by mutants deficient in the NEDD8-activating enzyme subunit AUXIN-RESISTANT 1 (AXR1). Here, we report a chemical biology screen that identifies small molecules requiring AXR1 to modulate plant development. We selected four molecules of interest, RubNeddin1 to 4 (RN1 to 4), among which RN3 and RN4 trigger selective auxin responses at transcriptional, biochemical and morphological levels. This selective activity is explained by their ability to consistently promote the interaction between TIR1 and a specific subset of AUX/IAA proteins, stimulating the degradation of particular AUX/IAA combinations. Finally, we performed a genetic screen using RN4, the RN with the greatest potential for dissecting auxin perception, which revealed that the chromatin remodeling ATPase BRAHMA is implicated in auxin-mediated apical hook development. These results demonstrate the power of selective auxin agonists to dissect auxin perception for plant developmental functions as well as offering opportunities to discover new molecular players involved in auxin responses.

PRJNA517021	A single-cell RNA sequencing profiles the developmental landscape of the root in Arabidopsis	Like no the same fingerprint, there is also no the same cell in plant. Cells have the inherent heterogeneity. Different cells possess different cellular identity. Recent advances in the single-cell gene expression studies enable one to explore transcriptional regulation in dynamic development processes and highly heterogeneous cell populations. Here, to reveal the gene expression property of root in single-cell level, we performed the high-throughput single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) assay. We found that the Arabidopsis root is highly heterogeneous. There are more than 24 clusters in the root cell populations. A series of new cluster-specific marker genes are identified. The spatial distribution of different cell types could reveal the hierarchy structure and reconstruct continuous differentiation trajectory of root cells. Thus, our studies identify certain cell types of root and present the intermediate states during root developmental process in the single-cell resolution. Less...

The functional screening and mechanism investigation of the genes in response to salt stress are essential for the development of salt-tolerant corps. Here, we found that Arabidopsis OXIDATIVE STRESS 2 (OXS2) is a salinity-induced gene, and its loss-of-function mutant (oxs2-1) is hypersensitive to salt stress during seed germination and root elongation processes. To explore the molecular mechanism of OXS2 in salt tolarance, its subcellular localization was detected with or without salinity; and the alteration of gene expressions between the wild-type and oxs2-1 was measured. The results revealed that AtOXS2 was predominantly localized in the nuclear upon salt stress, whereas AtOXS2 was primarily expressed in the cytoplasm under the control condition. Transcriptomic analysis revealed that multiple genes and pathways were downregulated under salt stress in the oxs2-1 plants compared with those in the wild-type plants. In conclusion, our results indicated that OXS2 confers salt tolerance in Arabidopsis through multiple stress-dependent pathways Less...

PRJNA482863	Effect of plastid transcription on genome integrity in Arabidopsis	Transcription can be an important natural source of genome instability. For instance, it may generate RNA:DNA hybrids as the nascent transcript hybridizes with the complementary DNA template. These hybrids, called R-loops, act as a major cause of replication fork stalling and DNA breaks. In this study, we used mutant lines known to be defective in plastid transcription to evaluate the effect of this process on the accumulation of DNA rearrangements in plastids of Arabidopsis thaliana. Additionally, we developed transgenic lines expressing a plastid-targeted RNAseH1 to study the impact of resolving R-loops on plastid genome stability. Less...

PRJNA472184	Genome-wide analysis of transcription in dek3 mutants and DEK3-over expressors	The decision of whether to grow and proliferate or to restrict growth and develop resilience to stress is a key biological trade-off. Multiple tumour suppressors have roles in suppressing growth and proliferation when conditions are unfavourable, and aggressive tumours show re-wiring of the metabolic pathways and removal of these restraints on growth. In plants, constitutive growth results in increased sensitivity to environmental stress. However, the underlying mechanisms controlling this decision are not well understood. We used temperature as a cue to discover regulators of this process in plants, as it both enhances growth and development rates within a specific range, and is also a stress at extremes. We find the conserved chromatin protein DEK plays a central role in balancing the response between growth and arrest in Arabidopsis, and it does this via H2A.Z-nucleosomes. DEK target genes show two distinct categories of chromatin architecture, and these predict induction or repression by DEK. We show that these chromatin signatures of DEK target genes might be conserved in human cells, suggesting that DEK may act through a fundamental evolutionarily conserved mechanism to control the balance between growth and arrest in plants and animals.

PRJNA483528	Dissecting drought stress responses of closely related Brassicaceae	Abiotic drought and salinity stress can cause severe crop losses and climate change is projected to increase their prevalence in future decades. Plants which are able to grow in hard environmental conditions are of interest to understand plant stress response mechanisms; especially given the limitations of Arabidopsis thaliana (Ath), which is mostly described as stress sensitive. The evolutionary proximity of extremophile Ath relatives like Arabidopsis lyrata (Aly) and Eutrema salsugineum (Esa) makes them a good model system to study adaptive stress response mechanisms. While their ability to survive extreme soil salinity is well investigated, their respective drought stress responses and differences to Ath are not well characterized. We use a combined large scale- phenotyping and transcriptomics analysis to study the dynamic response to drought of Ath, Aly and Esa. Our results showed that among species there are differences in morphology, physiology and transcriptome in response to drought conditions. Less...

PRJNA433852	Hydrogen peroxide positively regulates brassinosteroid signaling through oxidation of the BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 transcription factor (thale cress)	"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) is an important signaling molecule in plant developmental processes and stress responses. However, whether H2O2-mediated signaling can crosstalk with plant hormone signaling is largely unclear. Here, we show that H2O2 induces oxidation of the BRASSINAZOLE-RESISTANT1 (BZR1) transcription factor, which functions as a master regulator of Brassinosteroid (BR) signaling. Oxidative modification enhances BZR1 transcriptional activity by promoting its interaction with regulators of auxin- and light-signaling, including AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ARF6) and PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4). Genome-wide analysis shows that H2O2-dependent regulation of BZR1 activity plays a major role in modifying gene expression related to several BR-mediated biological processes. Furthermore, we show that the thioredoxin TRXh5 can interact with, and catalyze reduction of, BZR1. We conclude that reversible oxidation of BZR1 connects H2O2- and thioredoxin-mediated redox signaling to BR signaling to regulate plant development

In order to obtain a high resolution map of the changes of gene expression during this process thus to provide insights into specific expression patterns and their underlying gene regulatory networks, an inducible system which allows us to obtain synchronized flowers (Wellmer et al., 2006) was used to collect stage-specific floral tissues at four stages (stages 0, 2, 4 and 8) for transcriptome profiling by RNA-seq . These stages represent the status of inflorescence meristem, floral meristem specification, floral organ specification and floral organ differentiation, respectively during Arabidopsis flower development.

G4-seq allowed the high-throughput experimental mapping of G-quadruplexes in the human genome. We developed here an improved version of this method, named G4-seq2, which we applied to generate G-quadruplexes genomic maps for 12 species, selected as important models organism to study development or as pathogens of clinical relevance. Those multi-species maps, publicly available for the community, will allow to further understand the design principle of G-quadruplex formation in genomic context, to study G-quadruplex biology in those model organisms, to predict ligand targeting for therapeutic usage and to design G-quadruplex computational predictors based on genome-wide experimental measurements.

PRJNA434313	Salicylic acid inhibits transcriptional repression activities of its receptors to promote defense gene expression (thale cress)	"Salicylic acid (SA) is a plant defense hormone required for immunity. Arabidopsis NPR1 and NPR3/NPR4 were previously shown to bind SA and proposed as SA receptors. However, unlike NPR1, loss of NPR3/NPR4 does not block SA-induced defense gene expression.  Here we report that NPR3/NPR4 function as transcriptional repressors and SA inhibits their activities to promote the expression of key immune regulators. npr4-4D, a newly identified gain-of-function allele that renders NPR4 unable to bind SA, constitutively represses SA-induced immune responses. In contrast, the equivalent mutation in NPR1 abolishes its function in promoting SA-induced defense gene expression. Further analysis revealed that npr4-4D and npr1-1 have additive effect on blocking SA-induced defense gene expression, suggesting that NPR4 and NPR1 function in parallel to regulate SA-induced immune responses. Our study reveals the molecular functions of SA receptors NPR3/NPR4 and uncovers a brand new mechanism of SA perception.

PRJNA436256	The disease resistance protein SNC1 represses the biogenesis of microRNAs and phased siRNAs [mRNA] (thale cress)	"Plants evolved an array of disease resistance genes (R genes) to fight pathogens. In the absence of pathogen infection, NBS-LRR genes, which comprise a major subfamily of R genes, are suppressed by a small RNA cascade involving microRNAs (miRNAs) that trigger the biogenesis of phased siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from R gene transcripts. However, whether or how R genes influence small RNA biogenesis is unknown. In this study, we isolated a mutant with global defects in the biogenesis of miRNAs and phasiRNAs in Arabidopsis thaliana and traced the defects to the over accumulation and nuclear localization of an R protein SNC1. We showed that nuclear SNC1 represses the transcription of miRNA and phasiRNA loci, probably through the transcriptional corepressor TPR1. Intriguingly, nuclear SNC1 reduces the accumulation of phasiRNAs from three source R genes and concomitantly, the expression of a majority of the ~170 R genes was up-regulated. Taken together, this study reveals a new R gene-miRNA-phasiRNA regulatory module that regulates plants' growth-defense trade-off.

Yet how auxin achieves such functional diversity and specificity is largely unknown. Here, we address how different concentrations of auxin determine developmental responses through auxin signaling pathways, which are essential for differential growth including apical hook development. We showed that a high auxin concentration at concave side of the apical hook stimulated the C-terminus cleavage and cytosolic translocation of Transmembrane Kinase 1 (TMK1), which then phosphorylates non-canonical IAA32 and IAA34.  Surprisingly, and in contrast to the previous report that auxin degrades IAA proteins through the TIR1/AFB auxin receptor to regulate gene expression, here we found that non-canonical IAA32 and IAA34 proteins were stabilized by the high auxin concentration through TMK1 cleavage to negatively regulate gene expression and inhibit growth. Thus, we demonstrated that TIR1/AFB-independent transcriptional auxin signaling regulated growth inhibition in response to the high auxin concentration.

PRJNA445300	Cold priming and triggering of Arabidopsis accessions (thale cress)	"Plants from temperate regions can be primed by exposure to low, non-freezing temperatures resulting in improved freezing tolerance. Whereas the molecular and metabolic basis of cold priming has been investigated in detail, hardly anything is known about memory of a previous cold event under warm conditions and a following low temperature triggering event. We show that three days of cold priming at 4°C, a seven-day lag phase at 20°C and a triggering treatment of 4°C improved the freezing tolerance of Arabidopsis Col-0 and other accessions compared to plants that were not primed before. Transcripts, metabolites and lipids as possible molecular determinants of this increase in freezing tolerance were investigated in Arabidopsis accessions Col-0 and N14 after priming, memory phase and triggering by Illumina-based RNA-Seq, GC-MS metabolite profiling and UPLC FT-MS-based lipidomics. Comparing primed and triggered with only triggered samples 93 and 128 unique differentially expressed genes could be identified in Col-0 and N14, together with three and six significantly changed lipids and one metabolite in N14. Possible functions of these candidates will be discussed. This work identified for the first time molecular and metabolic changes accompanying cold stress memory and triggering by a second cold stress.

PRJNA448672	Genomic evidence reveals SPA-regulated developmental and metabolic pathways in dark-grown Arabidopsis seedlings (thale cress)	"Background: Photomorphogenesis is repressed in the dark mainly by an E3 ubiquitin ligase complex comprising CONSTITUTIVE PHOTOMORPHOGENIC 1 (COP1) and four homologous proteins called SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (SPA1-SPA4) in Arabidopsis. This complex induces the ubiquitination and subsequent degradation of positively acting transcription factors (e.g., HY5, HFR1, PAP1 and others) in the dark to repress photomorphogenesis. Genomic evidence showed a large number of genes regulated by COP1 in the dark, of which many are direct targets of HY5. However, the genomic bases for the constitutive photomorphogenic phenotypes of spaQ remain unknown.
Results: Here, we show that >7200 genes are differentially expressed in the spaQ background compared to wild type in the dark. Comparison of the RNAseq data between cop1 and spaQ revealed a large overlapping set of genes regulated by the COP1-SPA complex. In addition, many of the genes coordinately regulated by the COP1-SPA complex are also regulated by HY5 directly and indirectly. Moreover, a large number of genes (~2790) are predominantly regulated by SPA proteins and not by COP1, suggesting that SPA proteins might regulate many biological processes independently of COP1.
Conclusions: Taken together, our data reveal that SPA proteins repress photomorphogenesis by controlling expression of a large number of genes in concert with COP1, likely through regulating the abundance of downstream transcription factors in light signaling pathways. Moreover, SPA proteins may function both in a COP1-dependent and –independent manner in regulating many biological processes and developmental pathways in Arabidopsis.

In this study, we provide evidence from Arabidopsis that DET1 is essential for the regulation of histone H2B monoubiquitination (H2Bub) over most genes by controlling the stability of a plant deubiquitination module (DUBm). In contrast with yeast and metazoan DUB modules that are associated with the large SAGA complex, the Arabidopsis DUBm only comprises three proteins (hereafter named SGF11, ENY2 and UBP22) and appears to act independently as a major H2Bub deubiquitinase activity. Our study further unveils that DET1-DDB1-Associated-1 (DDA1) protein interacts with SGF11 in vivo, linking the DET1 complex to light-dependent ubiquitin-mediated proteolytic degradation of the DUBm. Collectively, these findings uncover a signaling path controlling DUBm availability, potentially adjusting H2Bub turnover capacity to the cell transcriptional status.

Our understanding of root immunity is still limited in comparison to the knowledge gained for the regulation of immune response in leaves. In an effort to reveal the organisation of root immunity in roots, we undertook a cell type-specific transcriptome analysis to identify gene networks in epidermis, cortex and pericycle cells of Arabidopsis roots upon treatment with two immunity elicitors, bacterial microbe-associated molecular pattern flagellin and the endogenous damage-associated molecular pattern Pep1. Our analyses revealed that both elicitors induced cell type-specific immunity gene networks. Interestingly, both elicitors did not alter cell identity determining gene networks. Using sophisticated paired motif promoter analyses, we identified key transcription factor pairs involved in the regulation of cell type-specific immunity networks. In addition, our data show that cell identity networks are liaised with cell immunity networks to activate cell type-specific immune response according to the functional capabilities of each cell type.

However, salt shock doesn’t occur in agricultural practice or natural ecosystem. In the fields, salts accumulate gradually through high salt or sodium irrigation water and poor managements that allow ground water to rise to soil surface. Therefore, it is more reasonable to research salinity stress in a mild way (stepwise salt addition). The objective of this study is to select marker genes to differentiate between salt shock (Phase 0) and salt stress (Phase 1). Three replicates were used for all RNA-Seq experiments conducted on control, Phase 0 and Phase 1 samples in Arabidopsis thaliana.

PRJNA451423	The plant-specific COST1 protein balances plant growth and drought tolerance via attenuation of autophagy (thale cress)	"Plants balance their conflicting requirements for growth and stress tolerance via sophisticated pathways and unique genes that control responses to the external environment. We have identified a novel plant-specific gene, COST1(Constitutively Stressed 1), that affects plant growth and negatively regulates drought resistance by manipulating the autophagy pathway. An Arabidopsis cost1 mutant has decreased growth and increased drought tolerance, together with constitutive autophagy and increased expression of drought-response genes. The COST1 protein is degraded upon plant dehydration, and this degradation is blocked by treatment with inhibitors of the 26S proteasome or autophagy pathways. The cost1 mutant drought resistance is dependent on an active autophagy pathway, indicating that COST1 acts through manipulation of autophagy. COST1 co-localizes to autophagosomes with the autophagosome marker ATG8e and the autophagy adaptor NBR1, and physically interacts with ATG8e, indicating a pivotal role in direct regulation of autophagy.

PRJNA454017	Compounds released by the biocontrol yeast Hanseniaspora opuntiae protect plants against Corynespora cassiicola and Botrytis cinerea (thale cress)	"Plant diseases induced by fungi are one of the most important limiting factors during pre- and post-harvest food production. For decades, synthetic chemical fungicides have been used to control these diseases, however, increase on worldwide regulatory policies and the demand to reduced their application, have led to search new ecofriendly alternatives such as the biostimulants. Commercial application of yeast as biocontrol, have shown low efficacy compared to synthetic fungicides, mostly due to the limited knowledge of the molecular mechanisms of yeast-induced responses. Interestingly, to date, only two genome-wide transciptomic analysis have been used to characterize the mode of action of biocontrols using the plant model Arabidopsis thaliana, missing, in our point of view, all its molecular and genomic potential. Here we described that compounds released by the biocontrol yeast Hanseniaspora opuntiae (HoFs) can protect Glycine max and Arabidopsis thaliana plants against the broad host-range necrotroph fungi Corynespora cassiicola and Botrytis cinerea, respectively. We show that HoFs have a long-lasting, dose-dependent local and systemic effect against Botrytis cinerea. Additionally, we performed a genome-wide transcriptomic analysis to identified HoFs-induced differentially expressed genes in Arabidopsis thaliana. Importantly, our work provides a novel and valuable information that can help the researchers to improve HoFs efficacy in order to become an ecofriendly alternative to synthetic fungicides

PRJNA454261	EML histone readers prevent seed development without fertilization (thale cress)	"EML1 and EML3 were previously shown to be histone readers involved in plant-pathogen interactions. To learn more about the developmental function of EML1 and EML3, we generated eml1 eml3 double mutant and showed that it had specific seed developmental phenotypes, including a capability to develop seed without fertilization. Next, we analyzed the mRNA expression of genes in the eml1 eml3 double mutant and compared it to its wild type. Differentially expressed (DE) genes in the mutant were identified and compared with DE of the mutants known to be involved in regulating seed development and in fertilization-independent endosperm development. Our results suggest that some targets are shared between EML histone readers and known regulators of seed development, such as MEA. Auxin response seems to be affected in both types of mutants. However, unlike MEA, EML proteins regulate auxin responsive genes not only in the endosperm, but also in the embryo. This capability makes EML proteins very good candidates for engineering apomictic seeds.

PRJNA454379	The KNOXI gene SHOOT MERISTEMLESS regulates floral fate in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Plants have evolved a unique and conserved developmental program that enables the conversion of leaves into floral organs. Elegant genetic and molecular work has identified key regulators of floral meristem identity. However, further understanding of flower meristem specification has been hampered by redundancy and by pleiotropic effects. The KNOXI gene STM transcription factor is a well-characterized regulator of shoot apical meristem maintenance. stm loss-of-function mutants arrest shortly after germination, and therefore the knowledge on later roles of STM, including flower development, is limited. Here, we uncover a role for STM in the specification of flower meristem identity. Silencing STM in the AP1 expression domain in the ap1-4 mutant background resulted in a complete leafy-like flower phenotype and an intermediate stm-2 allele enhanced the floral meristem identity phenotype of ap1-4. Transcriptional profiling of STM perturbation suggested that STM activity affects multiple meristem identity and flower transition genes, among them the F-Box gene UFO. In agreement, stm-2 enhanced the ufo-2 floral meristem fate phenotype, and ectopic UFO expression rescued the leafy flowers in genetic backgrounds with compromised AP1 and STM activities. This work suggests a molecular mechanism that underlies the activity of STM in the specification of flower meristem identity.

PRJNA454801	Hybrid vigour can be enhanced by delayed leaf senescence (thale cress)	"In agriculture hybrids are used extensively due to their superior performance in a number of traits such as seed yield, yet the molecular mechanisms underpinning their performance are not understood.  Recent evidence has suggested that a decrease in basal defence response genes regulated by reduced levels of the phytohormone salicylic acid (SA) may be important for hybrid vigour.  Decreasing levels of SA in the Arabidopsis accession C24 through the introduction of the SA catabolic enzyme NahG results in increased plant size phenocopying the increased size of C24/Ler F1 hybrids.  The increased growth of C24 NahG occurs during late development. Our transcriptome analysis of F1 hybrids and C24 NahG identified shared pathways associated with their size increase including decreased expression of defence response genes, SA biosynthetic genes, and SA response genes. In both C24 NahG and F1 hybrids we found decreased expression of key senescence transcription factors WRKY53, NAP and ORE1 and delayed senescence compared to C24. The delay in senescence resulted in an extension of active photosynthesis in the leaves of F1 hybrids compared to the parental lines allowing each leaf to produce more resources for the growth process.
Overall design: Samples analyzed included C24, C24B, Ler, C24 x Ler, C24 NahG 2, C24 NahG 3 and Ler NahG.  C24, Ler, Ler NahG and C24xLer all had three biological replicates.  C24B, C24 NahG 2 and C24 NahG 3 had two biological replicates.  C24 NahG 2 and C24 NahG 3 are two indepedent transgenic lines which ere sequenced at a later stage than the other samples.

PRJNA470574	miR394 and its target gene modulate BR signaling to regulate hypocotyls elongation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"MicroRNAs and phytophormes are all small molecular signals that play important roles in regulating development and environmental responses in plants. The interplay between them allow the plants to better converge multiple inner and outer signals to optimizing their survival strategy. So far, the knowledge of how miRNAs are involved in brassinosteroid (BR) signaling is lacking. Here, we report the finding of miR394 and its target gene LEAF CURLING RESPONSENESS (LCR), which were transcriptionally responsive to BR, participate in BR signaling in regulating hypocotyls elongation in Arabidopsis. By phenotypic analyzing of a set of transgenic and mutants, miR394 was found to act as a negative regulator in BR signaling in hypocotyls elongation, while its target gene on the contrary. Genetically, miR394 functions upstream of BIN2 and BZR1/BES1, but partially downstream or independent with BRI1 and BSU1. RNA-seq analysis further supports that miR394 inhibits BR signaling through BIN2 because miR394 co-regulate significant number of genes together with BIN2. Additionally, miR394 improved the accumulation of BIN2 but decreased the protein amount of BZR1 and BES1, which can be phosphorylated by BIN2. miR394 also repressed the transcription of PRE1/5/6 and EXP8, the key hypocotyls elongation regulating genes, which had been reported to be BZR1/BES1 targets. These findings revealed a new pathway that miRNA involved in BR signaling in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA470669	Interdependent nutrient availability and   steroid hormone signals facilitate root growth plasticity (thale cress)	"Plants acquire essential elements from inherently heterogeneous soils, in which phosphate and iron availabilities vary.  Consequently, plants developed adaptive strategies to cope with low iron and low phosphate levels, including alternation between root growth enhancement and attenuation. How this adaptive response is achieved remains unclear. Here, we found that low iron accelerates the root growth of Arabidopsis thaliana by activating brassinosteroid signaling, whereas low-phosphate-induced high iron accumulation inhibited it.  Altered hormone signaling intensity also modulated iron accumulation in the root elongation and differentiation zones, constituting a feedback response between brassinosteroid and iron. Surprisingly, the early effect of low iron levels on root growth required the brassinosteroid receptor but the hormone ligand was negligible. The brassinosteroid receptor inhibitor BKI1, the transcription factors BES1/BZR1 and the ferroxidase LPR1, stood at the base of this feedback loop.  Hence, shared brassinosteroid and iron regulatory components link nutrient status to root morphology, thereby driving the adaptive response.

PRJNA471077	Discovery of a novel plant eIF4E-binding protein: Conserved Binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1) (thale cress)	"Regulation of translation initiation is accomplished in diverse eukaryotes through proteins which bind to the mRNA cap-binding protein, eIF4E, and either prevent its association with eIF4G or form repressive mRNPs which exclude the translation machinery. Such mechanisms in plants, and even the presence of eIF4E-interacting proteins outside of eIF4G (and the plant-specific isoform eIFiso4G, which binds eIFiso4E) which operate in a gene regulatory manner are not known. Here we describe the Conserved Binding of eIF4E 1 (CBE1), a plant-specific protein with an evolutionarily conserved eIF4E binding motif. This protein binds eIF4E or eIFiso4E in vitro to form cap-binding complexes, and is found as a constituent of cap-binding complexes in vivo in an eIF4E-dependent manner. Mutants lacking CBE1 show dysregulation of cell cycle related transcripts, accumulating higher levels relative to wild-type plants of mRNAs encoding proteins involved in mitotic processes. These findings support CBE1 as a plant protein with the capability to form cap-binding complexes with the potential for gene regulatory activity.

PRJNA472158	A regulatory module controls plant growth and stress response by modulating hormone level (thale cress)	"Perception and relay of cell wall signals is critical for plants to regulate growth and stress responses, but the mechanism underlying this biological process remains largely unknown. Here we report that RAPID ALKALINIZATION FACTOR (RALFs) peptides, Leucine-rich repeat extensins (LRXs) and FERONIA (FER) are physically associated in extracellular region. lrx345, fer-4, and transgenic plants overexpressing RALF22 or RALF23 all showed retarded growth, increased sensitivity to salt stress, and constitutively increased levels of ABA, JA, and SA. Salt treatment or chemical disruption of cell wall promotes the release of mature RALF peptides, which negatively regulate the function of FER by inducing its internalization. JA mutants coi1 and aos restore the retarded growth, and mutation of ABA2 suppresses the salt-sensitive phenotype of lrx345. Together, we propose that LRXs, RALFs, and FER function as a module to sense and transduce cell wall signals, thereby regulating growth and stress responses via hormones-mediated pathways.

PRJNA472615	An essential role for Abscisic acid in the regulation of xylem fibre differentiation (thale cress)	"The Arabidopsis hypocotyl is an excellent model for understanding radial growth in plants. Division of the cambial cells and their subsequent differentiation into xylem and phloem drives radial expansion of the hypocotyl. Following the transition to reproductive growth, a phase change occurs in the Arabidopsis hypocotyl. During this second phase, the relative rate of xylem production is dramatically increased compared to that of phloem and xylem fibres containing thick secondary cell walls also form, which results in the production of xylem tissue comparable to the wood of trees. Abscisic acid (ABA) is a phytohormone known to have a major role in various plant processes, including in the response to changes in environmental conditions and in the promotion of seed dormancy. Using two different genetic backgrounds and different environmental conditions, we identified a set of core of transcriptional changes associated with the switch to the second phase of growth in the hypocotyl. ABA signalling pathways were identified as being as significantly over-represented in this set of core genes. Reverse genetic analysis demonstrated that mutants defective in ABA-biosynthesis enzymes exhibited significantly delayed fibre production without affecting the xylem:phloem ratio. The altered morphology is also reflected at the transcript level, with a reduced expression of marker genes associated with fibre formation in aba1 mutants. The application of exogenous ABA to the mutant rescued the phenotype, restoring fibre differentiation to wild-type levels. Taken together the data reveals an essential role for ABA in the regulation of fibre formation.

(thale cress)	"The shoot apical meristem of higher plants continuously generates new tissues and organs through complex changes in growth rates and directions of its individual cells. Cell growth, driven by turgor pressure, largely depends on the cell walls, which allow cell expansion through synthesis and structural changes. A previous study revealed a major contribution of wall isotropy in organ emergence, through the disorganization of cortical microtubules. We show here that this disorganization is coupled with the transcriptional control of genes involved in wall remodelling. Some of these genes are induced when microtubules are disorganized and cells shift to isotropic growth. Mechanical modelling shows that this coupling has the potential to compensate for reduced cell expansion rates induced by the shift to isotropic growth. Reciprocally, cell wall loosening induced by different treatments or altered cell wall composition promotes a disruption of microtubule alignment. Our data thus indicate the existence of a regulatory module activated during organ outgrowth, linking microtubule arrangements to cell wall remodelling.

PRJNA429247	Genome-wide occupancy of histone H3K27 methyltransferases CURLY LEAF and SWINGER in Arabidopsis seedlings (thale cress)	"The Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins form two protein complexes, PcG Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) and PRC2, which are key epigenetic regulators in eukaryotes. PRC2 represses gene expression by catalyzing the trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3). In Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), CURLY LEAF (CLF) and SWINGER (SWN) are two major H3K27 methyltransferases and core components of PRC2, playing essential roles in plant growth and development. Despite their importance, genome-wide binding profiles of CLF and SWN have not been determined and compared yet. In this study, we generated transgenic lines expressing GFP-tagged CLF/SWN under their respective native promoters and used them for ChIP-seq analyses to profile the genome-wide distributions of CLF and SWN in Arabidopsis seedlings. We also profiled and compared the global H3K27me3 levels in wild-type (WT) and PcG mutants (clf, swn, and clf swn). Our data show that CLF and SWN bind to almost the same set of genes, except that SWN has a few hundred more targets. Two short DNA sequences, the GAGA-like and Telo-box-like motifs, were found enriched in the CLF and SWN binding regions. The H3K27me3 levels in clf, but not in swn, were markedly reduced compared with WT; and the mark was undetectable in the clf swn double mutant. Further, we profiled the transcriptomes in clf, swn, and clf swn, and compared with that in WT. Thus this work provides a useful resource for the plant epigenetics community for dissecting the functions of PRC2 in plant growth and development.

However, virus-mediated acquisition of host genetic material, as deduced from historical events, appears to be rare. Here, we report spontaneous and surprisingly efficient generation of hybrid virus/host DNA molecules in the form of minicircles during infection of Beta vulgaris by Beet curly top Iran virus (BCTIV), a single-stranded DNA virus. The hybrid minicircles replicate, become encapsidated into viral particles, and spread systemically throughout infected plants in parallel with the viral infection. Importantly, when co-infected with BCTIV, B. vulgaris DNA captured in minicircles replicate and is transcribed in other plant species that are sensitive to BCTIV infection. Thus, we have likely documented in real time the initial steps of a possible path of virus-mediated horizontal transfer of chromosomal DNA between plant species.

However, a comprehensive understanding of the physiological significance of plant endopolyploidy has remained elusive. Here, we modeled and experimentally verified a high-resolution DNA endoploidy map of the developing Arabidopsis thaliana root, revealing a remarkable spatiotemporal control of DNA endoploidy levels across tissues and a strong dependence on stress signals. Cellular and transcriptomic analysis revealed that inhibition of endoreplication onset alters the nuclear-to-cellular volume ratio and change in expression of cell wall modifying genes, correlated with the appearance of cell structural changes. Our data indicate that endopolyploidy might serve to coordinate cell expansion with structural stability, and that spatiotemporal endoreplication pattern changes may buffer for stress conditions, which may explain the widespread occurrence of the endocycle in plant species growing in extreme or variable environments.

PRJNA474709	The histone H3K4 demethylase JMJ16 represses leaf senescence in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Leaf senescence is governed by a complex regulatory network involving dynamic reprogramming of gene expression. Recent evidence indicates that trimethylation of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me3) alters gene expression during leaf senescence. However, it is largely unknown how histone modification is regulated in an age-dependent manner. We found that JMJ16, an Arabidopsis JmjC-domain containing protein, is a specific H3K4 demethylase that negatively regulates leaf senescence. The histone demethylase activity and the JmjN, JmjC, and FYR domains of JMJ16, but not the zf-C5HC2 domain, are essential for JMJ16 function in the regulation of leaf senescence. Genome-wide analysis revealed a widespread coordinated up-regulation of H3K4me3 and gene expression associated with leaf senescence in the loss-of-function jmj16 mutant compared with the wild type. Genetic analysis indicated that JMJ16 negatively regulates leaf senescence at least partly through repressing the expression of WRKY53 and SAG201, two known positive regulators of leaf senescence. Further analyses demonstrated that JMJ16 associates with WRKY53 and SAG201, and represses precocious expression of WRKY53 and SAG201 in mature leaves by reducing H3K4me3 levels at these loci. Moreover, association of JMJ16 on WRKY53 and SAG201 loci increased at mature stage but decreased at later stage, suggesting that the age-dependent dynamic chromatin association of JMJ16 is required for precise transcriptional activation of SAGs during leaf senescence. Thus, JMJ16 is an important regulator of leaf senescence that demethylates H3K4 at senescence-associated genes in an age-dependent manner.

(thale cress)	"Purpose: Investigate whether a nuclear-encoded sigma factor (SIGMA FACTOR5, SIG5; controls chloroplast transcription) regulates the transcriptome (RNA-seq) in response to chilling.
Overall design: Col-0 wild type and sig5-3 seedlings were grown under light/dark cycles for 11 days and exposed to continuous light for 24 h before start of experiment.  After 24 h under continuous light, one set of seedlings was exposed to 5 h chilling (4 °C), commencing at ZT27, and the other set was exposed to 3 h of chilling, commencing at ZT45. Both sets of chilled samples had parallel controls that were not chilled (19 °C). Each treatment had 3 independent replicates. Total RNA was extracted and RNA sequencing libraries were prepared using the Illumina TruSeq Stranded mRNA kit. Sequencing was performed using an Illumina NextSeq 500 using NSQ 500 Hi-Output kit v2 (150 cycle). Sequence data were imported into Partek Genomics Suite version 6.6 (Partek, St. Louis, 385 MO, USA), further trimmed and aligned to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR11) using STAR (version 2.4.1d).

PRJNA475464	Comparative gene expression analysis in the Arabidopsis thaliana root apex using RNA-seq and microarray transcriptome profiles [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"The root apex is an important section of the plant root, involved in environmental sensing and cellular development. Analyzing the gene profile of root apex in diverse environments is important and challenging, especially when the samples are limiting and precious, such as in spaceflight. The feasibility of using tiny root sections for transcriptome analysis was examined in this study.To understand the gene expression profiles of the root apex, Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 roots were sectioned into Zone-I (0.5 mm, root cap and meristematic zone) and Zone-II (1.5 mm, transition, elongation and growth terminating zone). Gene expression was analyzed using microarray and RNA seq.Both the techniques, arrays and RNA-Seq identified 4180 common genes as differentially expressed (with > two-fold changes) between the zones. In addition, 771 unique genes and 19 novel TARs were identified by RNA-Seq as differentially expressed which were not detected in the arrays.
Single root tip zones can be used for full transcriptome analysis; further, the root apex zones are functionally very distinct from each other. RNA-Seq provided novel information about the transcripts compared to the arrays. These data will help optimize transcriptome techniques for dealing with small, rare samples.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana var. Columbia (COL-0) seedlings were grown on sterile solid media plates containing 0.5 % phytagel. The plates were vertically placed in growth chambers with continuous light (80-100 µmol m -2) at a constant temperature of 19° C. Eight day old seedlings were harvested into RNA-later solution in a 50 mL centrifuge tubes and stored at -20 °C freezer.

PRJNA475542	Widespread inter-individual gene expression variability in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"A fundamental question in biology is how gene expression is regulated to give rise to a phenotype. However, transcriptional variability is rarely considered and could influence the relationship between genotype and phenotype. It is known in unicellular organisms that gene expression is often noisy rather than uniform and has been proposed to be beneficial when environmental conditions are unpredictable. However, little is known about transcriptional variability in multicellular organisms. Using transcriptomic approaches, we analysed gene expression variability over a 24 hours time-course between individual Arabidopsis thaliana plants growing in stable conditions. We identified hundreds of genes that exhibit high inter-individual variability and found that many are involved in environmental responses. We also identified factors that might facilitate gene expression variability, such as gene size, the number of transcription factors regulating a gene and the chromatin environment. These results will bring a new light into the impact of transcriptional variability in gene expression regulation in plants.
Overall design: RNA-seq were generated for 14 individual seedlings for each of the 12 following time points: ZT2, ZT4, ZT6, ZT8, ZT10, ZT12 (just before dusk), ZT14, ZT16, ZT18, ZT20, ZT22 and ZT24 (just before dawn).

PRJNA475545	Light releases the TCP4-SAUR16/50 transcription module from the repression of PIF3 to facilitate cotyledon opening during de-etiolation [RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Etiolated Arabidopsis seedlings open their cotyledons and halt rapid elongation of hypocotyl when exposed to light (de-etiolation). Major light responsive components in this process have been identified and signaling pathways revealed, yet how the organ-specific light responses are achieved remains unknown. Here we report that a developmental regulator TCP4 (TEOSINTE BRANCHED1, CYCLOIDEA, and PCF) participates in photomorphogenesis and facilitates light-induced cotyledon-opening. We demonstrate that TCP4-like transcriptional factors, which predominantly express in cotyledons of both light and dark seedlings, activate SAUR16 and SAUR50 in response to light. Light repressor PIF3 (or PIFs, phytochrome-interacting factors), which accumulates in etiolated seedlings and rapidly declines upon light exposure, inhibits TCP4 promoter-binding and prevents activation of SAUR16/50 in darkness. Our study reveals how an interplay between light responsive factors and developmental regulators leads to signal-dependent and tissue-specific regulation of gene expressions, which ultimately resulted in organ-specific light responses during de-etiolation.
Overall design: Cotyledon mRNA profiles of 4-day-old dark grown Col, mTCP4#4 and mTCP4#10 seedlings were generated by deep sequencing. Less..."

PRJNA476580	RNA Polymerase II read-through promotes expression of neighboring genes in SAL1-PAP-XRN retrograde signaling (thale cress)	"Abstract: In plants, the molecular function(s) of the nuclear localised 5’-3’ EXORIBONUCLEASES (XRNs) are unclear, however their activity is reported to have a significant effect on gene expression and SAL1-mediated retrograde signaling. Using Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE) we document a dramatic increase in uncapped RNA substrates of the XRNs in both sal1 and xrn2xrn3 mutants. We find that a major consequence of reducing SAL1 or XRN activity is RNA Polymerase II (Pol II) 3’ read-through. This occurs at 72% of expressed genes, demonstrating a major genome-wide role for the XRN-torpedo model of transcription termination in Arabidopsis. Read-through is speculated to have a negative effect on transcript abundance, however we do not observe this. Rather, we identify a strong association between read-though and increased transcript abundance of tandemly orientated downstream genes, strongly correlated with the proximity (<1,000bp) and expression of the upstream gene. We observe read-though in the proximity of 903 genes upregulated in the sal1-8 retrograde signaling mutant; thus, this phenomenon may directly account for up to 23% of genes upregulated in sal1-8. Using APX2 and AT5G43770 as exemplars, we genetically uncouple read-through loci from downstream genes to validate the principle of read-through mediated mRNA regulation, potentially providing one mechanism by which an obstensibly post-transcriptional exoribonuclease that targets uncapped RNAs could modulate gene expression.

PRJNA476778	Contribution of time of day and the circadian clock to the heat stress responsive transcriptome in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"In Arabidopsis, a large subset of heat responsive genes exhibits diurnal or circadian oscillations. However, to what extent the dimension of time and/or the circadian clock contribute to heat stress responses remains largely unknown. To determine the direct contribution of time of day and/or the clock to differential heat stress responses, we probed wild-type and mutants of the circadian clock genes CCA1, LHY, PRR7, and PRR9 following exposure to heat (37°C) and moderate cold (10°C) in the early morning (ZT1) and afternoon (ZT6). Thousands of genes were differentially expressed in response to temperature, time of day, and/or the clock mutation. Approximately 30% more genes were differentially expressed in the afternoon compared to the morning, and heat stress significantly perturbed the transcriptome. Of the DEGs (~3000) specifically responsive to heat stress, ~70% showed time of day (ZT1 or ZT6) occurrence of the transcriptional response. For the DEGs (~1400) that are shared between ZT1 and ZT6, we observed changes to the magnitude of the transcriptional response. In addition, ~2% of all DEGs showed differential responses to temperature stress in the clock mutants. The findings in this study highlight a significant role for time of day in the heat stress responsive transcriptome, and the clock through CCA1 and LHY, appears to have a more profound role than PRR7 and PRR9 in modulating heat stress responses during the day. Our results emphasize the importance of considering the dimension of time in studies on abiotic stress responses in Arabidopsis.
Overall design: We used RNA-sequencing to measure transcriptomic changes in Columbia-0 (WT), cca1-1/lhy-20 (cca1lhy) and prr7-3/prr9-1 (prr7prr9) under 1 h of moderate cold (10°C) and 1 h of heat stress (37°C). Samples were collected at ZT1 and ZT6.

We investigated the role of calmodulin (CaM)-binding transcription activator 6 (CAMTA6) under salinity stress during early germination in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA478857	A conserved odor detection pathway via modulation of chromatin and cellular gene expression	"Odorants in the environment that can cross the cell membrane are likely important detection targets for a conserved pathway and using one such odorant, diacetyl, we show that the ancient family of histone deacetylase enzymes (HDACs) can act as an atypical odorant detection pathway. Based on our testing we demonstrate that this response meets 6 characteristics of an odor-sensing pathway to odorant exposure: (1) a highly specific response to volatile compounds by altering gene expression, (2) differential modulation of different HDACs, (3) dose-dependent response in vitro, (4) dose-dependent response in vivo, (5) reversible to some degree, and (6) highly conserved across eukaryotes such as invertebrates, vertebrates and plants. We observe that exposure to diacetyl vapors modulates gene expression over a period of days in the Drosophila antenna. The up-regulated genes significantly overlap with genes altered by known histone deacetylase inhibitors administered in the food. In vitro assays with purified human proteins showed that different members of  class I HDACs are differentially inhibited. Moreover exposure to diacetyl increased histone H3K4 acetylation in a human cell line. Organisms spanning multiple taxa can respond to diacetyl volatiles by altering gene expression, presumably in part via inhibition of histone deacetylase proteins causing epigenetic changes. Our finding reveals a highly conserved and slow-acting pathway for responding to odorants beyond the fast-acting neuronal activation via transmembrane receptors, and raises questions about the effects of this odorant detection pathway on physiology and health of organisms.

One class of noncoding RNA, the cis-natural antisense transcripts (cis-NATs), are particularly interesting as they are at least partially complementary to the protein-coding mRNAs. Although most studies described cis-NATs involved in the regulation of transcription, a few reports have shown recently that cis-NATs can also regulate translation of the cognate sense coding genes in plants and mammals. In order to identify novel examples of translation regulator cis-NATs in Arabidopsis thaliana, we designed a high-throughput experiment based on polysome profiling and RNA-sequencing. Expression of cis-NATs and translation efficiency of the cognate coding mRNAs were measured in roots and shoots in response to various conditions, including phosphate deficiency and treatment with phytohormones. We identified several promising candidates, and validated a few of them experimentally, in Arabidopsis thaliana transgenic lines over-expressing in trans the translation regulator candidate cis-NATs.

PRJNA480966	RNA polymerase II activity revealed by GRO-seq and pNET-seq in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"RNA polymerase II (Pol II) play an essential role in gene expression. Here, we adapted plant Native Elongation Transcript sequencing and Global Run On sequencing to profile nascent RNA genome wide in Arabidopsis. We found Pol II tends to accumulate downstream of transcription start site and pausing at proximal promoter is an important regulatory step for Pol II transcription although loosely controlled. Furthermore, the Pol II with unphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) mainly accumulates downstream the TSS, while the Ser5P CTD Pol II associates with spliceosome, and the Ser2P CTD Pol II presents a sharp peak 250 base pair downstream of polyadenylation site indicating a stringent control of termination for protein coding genes; whilst the termination of noncoding genes is not. Active expressed genes can be classified into three clusters according to the distribution patterns of different Pol II isoforms. In summary, we demonstrated the modified plant GRO-seq and pNET-seq are suitable to study RNA Pol II dynamics in planta. Although transcription is conserved among high eukaryotes, Pol II has its feature in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA480911	Transcriptome analysis of apoplastic reactive oxygen species signaling in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions with varying ozone sensitivity. (thale cress)	"Ozone (O3) is a phytotoxic air pollutant that enters the plant through stomata and activates cell death programs leading to development of lesions in sensitive plant species. Exposure to O3 provokes the formation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) in the apoplast of plant cells. Imbalanced ROS homeostasis has deleterious toxic effects on DNA, proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. However, ROS are not merely damaging molecules, as they also initiate signaling events that help plants acclimate to stress. Like under most abiotic and biotic stresses, apoplastic ROS signaling triggered by O3 induces massive changes in gene expression, enzyme activities and metabolic profiles. Thus, O3 is a very useful tool to study general mechanisms of ROS signaling and regulation of gene expression. Here we used a combination of transcriptome analysis and cell death assays to identify molecular mechanism initiated by apoplastic ROS signaling involved in the regulation of defense signaling and cell death in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Overall design: Transcriptome profiling of ozone response in three Arabidopsis accessions with different ozone sensitivity (Col-0, Shahdara and Cvi-0) to identify molecular mechanisms triggered by apoplastic ROS signaling.

PRJNA481007	Arabidopsis spliceosome factor SmD3-b modulates immunity to Pseudomonas syringae infection (thale cress)	"SmD3 is a core protein of small nuclear ribonucleoproteins essential for pre-mRNA splicing. To assess the role of Arabidopsis SmD3-b in response to biotic stress we investigated sensitivity of the smd3-b mutant to Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 infection and its pathogenesis effectors flg22, elf18 and coronatine. We show that the mutant exhibits enhanced susceptibility to Pst accompanied with marked changes in the expression of key pathogenesis markers. mRNA levels of major biotic stress response factors were also altered upon treatment with Pseudomonas effectors. Our genome-wide transcriptome analysis of smd3-b mutant infected with Pst confirmed that lack of SmD3 protein deregulates defense to Pst DC3000 infection on the transcriptional level, including defects in splicing and altered pattern of alternative splicing. In addition, callose deposition, which is another marker of plant immunity, was strongly induced by elf18 and flg22 in the mutant, whereas production of reactive oxygen species triggered by flg22 was reduced. Finally, detection of phosphorylated forms of MPK3, MPK6 and MPK4/11 revealed higher activation of all MAPKs in the smd3-b mutant. All our data indicate that SmD3 contributes to plant immune response possibly via regulation of mRNA splicing of the key pathogenesis factors.

Although lariat RNAs are usually degraded by DBR1 (RNA debranching enzyme 1), recent findings in animals showed that many lariat RNAs were widely detected under physiological conditions. In contrast, the features of BPs and to what extent lariat RNAs accumulate naturally are largely unexplored in plants. Here, we analyzed 948 RNA sequencing datasets to document plant BPs and lariat RNAs on a genome-wide scale. In total, we identified 13872, 5199, 29582, and 13478 BPs in Arabidopsis, tomato, rice, and maize, respectively. Features of plant BPs are highly similar to those in yeast and human, in that BPs are adenine-preferred and flanked by uracil-enriched sequences. Intriguingly, ~20% of introns harbor multiple BPs, and BP usage is tissue-specific. Furthermore, 10580 lariat RNAs accumulate in wild type Arabidopsis plants, and most of these lariat RNAs originate from longer or retroelement-depleted introns, and the expression of these lariat RNAs significantly correlated with the incidence of back-splicing of parent exons. Collectively, our results provide the first comprehensive map of intron BPs and lariat RNAs in plants, and uncover a novel link between lariat turnover and splicing.

PRJNA482056	Next Generation Sequencing Facilitates Quantitative Analysis of mock and tobacco ratle virus (TRV) Arabidopsis inflorescences Transcriptome [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Purpose: The goal of this study is to compare the transcriptome profilling (RNA-seq) of inflorescences infected with tobacco ratle virus (TRV) to mock inoculated inflorescences (negative controls), in Arabidopsis plants
Methods: Inflorescences of systemically TRV infected or mock-inoculated plants were collected from more than 40 independent Arabidopsis plants, at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi). TRV and mock mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing by Illumina HiSeq 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters (SOAPnuke) were analysed by Burrows-Wheeler (BWA) followed by ANOVA (ANOVA) and TopHat followed by Cufflinks. Genes and isoforms were quantified by RSEM sofware package. qRT-PCR validation was performed using TaqMan and SYBR Green assays.
Results: Here we report   a significant repression of DNA methylation genes in inflorescences of Arabidopsis plants infected with Tobacco rattle virus (TRV) that coincides with dynamic changes in methylation at the whole genome level. Arabidopsis mutants deficient in DNA methylation were more resistant to this virus in early colonized tissues but more susceptible at later time points of infection, indicating that DNA methylation was critical to control both proliferation and antiviral defense. We found that TRV interference with DNA methylation leads to changes in the methylation and trancriptional status of transposable elements (TEs), including TEs located in the promoter of disease resistance genes that were significantly repressed in plants exposed to TRV. Activation of both TEs and their nearby disease resistance genes was altered in a range of hypo- and hyper-methylated Arabidopsis mutants, indicating that perturbations in DNA methylation contributes to modulate their expression in infected plants.
Conclussion: Our study showed that TRV interferes with DNA methylation to alter the transcriptional silencing of TEs, which in turn compromises the expression of neighboring disease resistance genes.

PRJNA483876	The repressive role of H2A.Z variant in transcriptional regulation depends on AtBMI1 activity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"H2A.Z variant has emerged as a critical player in regulating plant responses to environment; however, the mechanism by which H2A.Z mediates this regulation remains unclear. In Arabidopsis, H2A.Z has been proposed to have opposite effects on transcription depending on its localization within the gene. These opposite roles have been assigned by correlating gene expression and H2A.Z enrichment analyses but without considering the impact of possible H2A.Z posttranslational modifications. Here we show that H2A.Z can be monoubiquitinated by the PRC1 components AtBMI1A/B/C. The incorporation of this modification is required for H2A.Z-mediated transcriptional repression through a mechanism that does not require PRC2 activity. Our data suggest that the dual role of H2A.Z in regulating gene expression depends on the modification that it carries, while the levels of H2A.Z within genes depend on the transcriptional activity.

PRJNA484219	Multivalent H3K9me2 Reader ADCP1 Functions as a plant HP1 to Maintain Epigenetic Silencing (thale cress)	"Heterochromatin formation is important for genome stability and transposon silencing. The evolutionally conserved Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) recognizes H3K9me3 and maintains heterochromatin from fission yeast to mammalians. However, it is still questioned about the presence of HP1 protein in plants. Here, we discovered a multivalent H3K9me2 reader ADCP1 in Arabidopsis through biophysical and structural studies, and agenet domain in ADCP1 has the similar function of chromo domain in HP1. We further showed that ADCP1 was essential for heterochromatin maintenance through modulating H3K9me2 and DNA methylation levels. Similar to human HP1alpha and fly HP1a, ADCP1 was also able to mediate heterochromatin phase separation both in vitro and in vivo. Our results demonstrate the plant specific and evolution conserved ADCP1 functions as the HP1 equivalent protein in plant.

Although this capacity was recognized more than 100 years ago, our mechanistic understanding of the establishment, maintenance, and erasure of cellular identities in plants remains limited. Here we develop a cell-type specific reprogramming system than can be probed at the genome-wide scale for alterations in gene expression and histone modifications before and during reprogramming. We show that the relationship between H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 and gene expression in a single cell type mirrors trends from more complex tissue, and that H3K27me3 dynamics is a critical regulator of guard cell identity. Further, guard cells can sense and resist inappropriate reprogramming, in part via regulation of the wounding response through H3K27me3. The matched single cell-type ChIP-seq and RNA-seq datasets created for this analysis also serve as a resource enabling inquiries into the dynamic and global-scale distribution of histone modifications.

PRJNA485348	A variably imprinted epiallele impacts seed development (thale cress)	"The contribution of epigenetic variation to phenotypic variation is unclear. Imprinted genes, because of their strong association with epigenetic modifications, represent an opportunity for the discovery of such phenomena. In mammals and flowering plants, a subset of genes are expressed from only one parental allele in a process called gene imprinting. Imprinting is associated with differential DNA methylation and chromatin modifications between parental alleles. In flowering plants imprinting occurs in endosperm seed tissue. Proper endosperm development is essential for the production of viable seeds.  We previously showed that in Arabidopsis thaliana intraspecific imprinting variation is correlated with naturally occurring DNA methylation polymorphisms. Here, we investigated the mechanisms and function of allele-specific imprinting of the class IV homeodomain-Leucine zipper (HD-ZIP) transcription factor HDG3. In imprinted strains, HDG3 is expressed primarily from the methylated paternally inherited allele. We manipulated the methylation state of endogenous HDG3 in a non-imprinted strain and demonstrated that methylation of a proximal transposable element is sufficient to promote HDG3 expression and imprinting. Gain of HDG3 imprinting was associated with earlier endosperm cellularization. These results indicate that epigenetic variation alone is sufficient to explain imprinting variation and show that epialleles can underlie variation in seed development phenotypes.

Similar to BRIC-Seq, we performed 5-EU IP chase (ERIC)-Seq in seedlings of A. thaliana. Hierarchical clustering of gene expression values allowed us to define at least five clusters of mRNAs that exhibited distinct degradation kinetics. To determine the RNA half-lives of each group, we applied an exponential decay model and a locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS) and calculated the time where the concentration was halved.  It became obvious that the half-lives determined by ERIC-Seq are much shorter than the ones determined after treatment with cordycepin or actinomycin D, respectively. We found that genes belonging to cluster A exhibiting the shortest half-lives are enriched in genes transcribed into non-coding RNAs, stress-related genes, genes involved in hormonal pathways and the metabolism of polyamines, which are also involved in stress responses. On the contrary, genes from cluster E, which have the longest half-lives, are specifically enriched in genes responsible for mitochondrial and plastic functions as well as primary metabolism (such as the TCA cycle)

PRJNA486575	Characterizing Epigenetic Changes in Methylation Mutants (elp2-5 and met1-7) in Response to Spaceflight. [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Epigenetic changes in the DNA methylome are increasingly shown to play an integral role in regulating gene expression necessary for plants’ adaption to environmental stressors. Plants subjected to the novel environment of spaceflight onboard the International Space Station (ISS), show stress-related transcriptomic changes most notably associated with pathogen stress response. Here, we investigate how known terrestrial stress associated epigenetic modulations might play a role in spaceflight adaptation. To examine the role of 5mCyt in spaceflight adaptation, the APEX04-EPEX experiment conducted onboard the ISS evaluated the spaceflight altered genome wide methylation profiles of two methylation regulating gene mutants (methyltransferase 1 (met1-7) and elongator complex subunit 2 (elp2-5)) that are involved in pathogen defense response, along with a wild type Col-0 control. MethylSeq and RNAseq analyses were performed on both spaceflight grown samples and ground grown controls. In addition, the epigenetics effects that may contribute to the differential gene expression patterns observed between leaf and root tissues were also investigated in an organ-specific manner.
Overall design: Sterilized Arabidopsis thaliana seeds of the Columbia (Col-0), met1-7 or elp2-5 genotype were sown onto the surface of 100 mm2 square petri dishes containing a solid medium of 0.5% Phytagel™ /0.5x MS media and then wrapped in Duvetyne™ cloth. The plates were stored at 4°C and remained dormant until its installation into the Vegetable Production System (Veggie) hardware on the ISS and a comparable set installed into the Veggie hardware on the ISS Environmental Simulator (ISSES) chamber at Kennedy Space Center (KSC). These plates made up the NASA Advanced Plant Experiment 04 – Epigenetic Expression (APEX04-EPX) experiment that was launched on the SpaceX mission CRS-10. Plants in the Veggie hardware were exposed to constant light conditions of 100-135 µmoles/m2/s PAR and grown for eleven days before being harvested into Kennedy Space Center Fixation Tubes (KFTs) and fixed in RNAlater™ (Ambion, Grand Island, NY, USA). Samples from each plate were harvested into individual KFTs. The KFTs were then stowed at -80°C in the MELFI freezer aboard the ISS. The comparable ground control samples were also harvested into KFTs and stored in a standard -80°C freezer. All samples were kept frozen until delivery to the laboratory for analysis. Each plate was used as a biological replicate and a total of 4 replicates were used for the analyses.

PRJNA486520	Transcriptome of the Arabidopsis mRNA export mutant aly1 and associated controls (thale cress)	"RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is a set of mechanisms by which transcriptionally-repressive DNA methylation and histone modifications are targeted de novo to transposable element and transgene regions of the genome. We identified a mutant in which all forms of RdDM are deficient, leading to the transcriptional activation of some transposable elements and the complete inability to initiate transgene silencing. The mutated gene, ALY1, encodes an RNA-binding nuclear export protein belonging to a family of four ALY proteins in Arabidopsis. ALY proteins function together to export a large number of mRNAs from the nucleus for translation, but we found that ALY1 is unique in its ability to enable RdDM. We sequenced methylomes (via MethylC-seq) to identify the genome-wide loss of CHH methylation targeted by RdDM in aly1 mutants. We sequenced small RNAs and determined that ALY1 functions in RdDM downstream of small RNA production and export. We sequenced total, nuclear and cytoplasmic mRNAs to determine that ALY1 functions in the nuclear export directly or indirectly on 2,612 mRNAs. Additionally, we sequenced RNAs bound to the ALY1 protein using RNA-immunoprecipitation followed by high throughput sequencing.

PRJNA117297	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)smRNAs in wildtype and RDR6-15 knockout Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 leaf	"This set consists of small RNAs sequenced from two replicates of wildtype and two replicates of RDR6-15 knockout Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 leaf samples. RDR6 is required for the production of tasRNAs (trans-acting small RNAS) and so tags associated with the tasRNA loci should be severely down-regulated or absent in the knockout compared to wildtype. The set can thus be used as containing known true positives for testing differential expression detection methods.

PRJNA304664	Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia-0 (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia-0 Raw sequence reads	Little is known about the direct targets of stress-induced ATP hydrolysis. However, two inner mitochondrial membrane proteins, LEUCINE ZIPPER-EF-HAND-CONTAINING TRANSMEMBRANE (AtLETM1, At3g59820 and AtLETM2, At1g65540) have been identified that de-regulate this process. By following the reduction in cellular adenosine 5′-triphosphate (ATP) in wild-type (Col-0) and two independent letm1/LETM2(+/-) lines (two to three biological replicates of each genotype) via NGS showed that the free energy state altered the expression and timing of the circadian clock, as well as optimum plastid function during water deficit stress. Files containing these NGS data are deposited here. Seeds were surface sterilized, directly sown on soil (1:3:1 vermiculite:soil:perlite) and allowed to vernalize for 2 days at 4oC before grown for 43 days after germination (DAG) at 20°C/18°C day/night regime (16h/8h) at a light intensity of 120µmol.m-2.s-1 and 65% relative humidity. For well-watered treatments, 43DAG plants were grown in soil with watering to 90% soil water content every 2 days; for water deficit treatments, 30DAG plants grown as above were discontinued of watering to 40% soil water content and kept constant. The sixth rosette leaf was harvested and used to prepare total RNA. RNA libraries were generated from 500-1000ng of input RNA with the TruSeq Stranded Total RNA with Ribo-ZeroTM Plant kit (Illumina) for Illumina sequencing. Less...	
PRJNA485673	Transcriptome analysis of wild-type and TaMYB31 overexpressing Arabidopsis	To decipher the possible mechanism of TaMYB31 in regulating Arabidopsis drought tolerance, comparative gene expression analysis was conducted in transgenic and WT plants using RNA-seq. A total of 359 genes were found to be differentially expressed (fold change >2, false discovery rate <0.01). Of these, 238 genes were up-regulated and 121 were down-regulated in transgenic plants.

RNA Seq data reveal that overexpression of AtAPY1 and AtAPY2 results in significantly different gene expression profiles. These differences provide a molecular basis for phenotypic differences in the two transgenic lines. Less...

PRJNA484670	Pseudouridylation of mRNA and non-coding RNAs in Arabidopsis	Pseudouridine (Ψ), the most abundant modified nucleoside, has been addressed to widely occur in mRNA and non-coding RNAs in yeast, human, mammals and the parasite Toxoplasma gondii; and its position and specificity in these RNAs are also revealed. However, the distribution and feature of Ψs in various RNAs, particularly in mRNA in plants remain elusive. In this report, we performed a genome wide and single-nucleotide-resolution pseudouridine sequencing, and identified hundreds of Ψ sites in mRNA and multiple Ψ sites in rRNAs, tRNA and other RNAs in Arabidopsis for the first time. Many predicted and novel Ψ sites in Arabidopsis rRNAs and tRNA were detected. Less...	
PRJDB4316	Sorghum bicolor (sorghum)Novel techniques of tailor-made breeding for energy crop improvement using high-throughput genotyping	Sorghum, which is mainly used for fodder, also has high potential as a raw material for bioenergy. For bioenergy purposes it is imperative to breed a cultivar that both grows robustly and contains ample amounts of the components that can easily be converted into ethanol. With this research, we will make skillful use of the latest genome analysis techniques and establish new techniques for the rapid production of cultivars. Targeting areas of cultivation where there are actual plans for ethanol production, we will develop techniques to create new varieties optimized for the environment of each particular region. Less...

Plants have Al tolerance mechanisms associated with transcriptomic change in roots. However, the most of expressed genes involved in difference of Al-tolerance are still unknown. To identify the Al-tolerance genes in Arabidopsis accessions with varying of Al tolerance, comparative transcriptome analysis in roots was performed between six A. thaliana accessions which exhibit clear difference in Al tolerance. RNA samples were extracted from roots of 10-d-old seedlings treated with and without Al, and then were applied to RNA-Seq analysis. This study identified differentially expressed gene groups among Arabidopsis accessions. Differentially expressed genes between tolerant and sensitive accessions were also selected as the Al-tolerance candidate genes. Less...

PRJDB5858	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Gauss-Power mixing Distributions in RNA-seq data of Arabidopsis thaliana	"Gene expression levels exhibit stochastic variations among genetically identical organisms under the same environmental conditions (called gene expression ""noise"" or phenotype ""fluctuation""). In many recent transcriptome analysis based on RNA-seq, the variations of gene expression levels among replicates were empirically assumed to obey the negative binomial distribution. In this study, RNA-seq data were obtained from 8 conditions (19 ~ 26-reprlcate) of Arabidopsis thaliana, and analyzed the characteristics of gene-dependent distribution profiles of the gene expression levels. These distribution profiles could be suitably fitted by a novel distribution function named Gauss-Power mixing distribution, which was derived from a simple model of the stochastic transcription network containing the feedback loop. By such analysis, the distribution profiles of the gene expression levels were roughly divided to three types named Gaussian like type, power law like type containing long tail, and mixture type. The present fitting function predicted that the gene expression levels showing the distributions with long tail tend to be strongly influenced by the feedback of the change in their expression levels. These results also showed the features of gene expression levels correlate to their functions where the gene expression levels of essential genes tend to show Gauss type distributions while that of genes of nucleic acid binding proteins and transcription factors tend to show long tailed distributions.

We characterized the initiation of somatic embryos (SEs) in the shoot apices of young seedlings of Arabidopsis thaliana. In this system, SEs are induced by application of osmotic stress and subsequent culture on media containing 2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetate (2,4-D). By using RNA-sequencing, we examined the transcriptome profiles of explants before and after stress application (named Shoot apex and Stress, respectively), and SE-forming and non-SE-forming explants at days 3 and 5 of SE induction, sorted by the presence or absence of the signal of an embryonic reporter (named day-3-positive, day-3-negative, day-5-positive, and day-5-negative-explants, respectively).

PRJEB21008	Establishment of photosynthesis through chloroplast development is controlled by two distinct regulatory phases	A pluripotent inducible cell line was generated from Arabidopsis to address the limitations of traditional in planta dicot systems and to develop a well-controlled experimental setup where the individual regulatory check points of chloroplast development could be defined. Following light exposure, this cell line was shown to differentiate into photosynthetically active cells with functional chloroplasts providing an experimental system with a temporal gradient of chloroplast development. Using this unique cell line from the dicot Arabidopsis we could demonstrate that the development from a proplastid to a functional chloroplast, and thereby the establishment of photosynthesis, is dependent on a regulatory mechanism involving two distinct phases. First, light exposure triggers an initial change in gene expression, metabolite profile, chlorophyll accumulation and plastid structure. Secondly, a second signal, most likely triggered by activation of the chloroplast, is required for full transition to a functional chloroplast and the shift from heterotrophic to photoautotrophic metabolism.

PRJEB23627	Transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana to exogenous application of pipecolic acid	We have previously shown that the resistance increase observed after biological systemic acquired resistance (SAR) induction in plants can be mimicked by exogenous plant treatment with (pipecolic acid) Pip (Návarová et al., 2012; Bernsdorff et al., 2016). In order to investigate whether elevations of Pip are sufficient for a SAR-like transcriptional reprogramming in leaf tissue, we supplied individual Arabidopsis Col-0 and fmo1 mutant plants with doses of 10 µmol Pip and determined the transcriptional response in leaves one day later on the whole genome level by RNA-sequencing analyses in relation to untreated plants. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil, vermiculite and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h day (9 AM to 7 PM; photon flux density 100 mol m-2 s-1) / 14-h night cycle and a relative humidity of 70 %. Day and night temperatures were set to 21°C and 18°C, respectively. Experiments were performed with 5- to 6-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance.Treatments with Pip were essentially performed as detailed in Návarová et al. (2012).10 ml of a 1 mM aqueous solution of Pip (equates to 10 µmol) were pipetted onto the soil of individually cultivated plants. 10 ml of water were applied in the control treatments. Three biologically independent, replicate experiments were performed. In each experiment, at least 4 full-grown leaves from 6 different plants were pooled 24 hours after the treatment with Pip or water for one biological replicate. In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained. Less...	
PRJEB24412	PORCUPINE (PCP) regulates development in response to temperature variations through alternative splicing in Arabidopsis	Plant development and growth are strongly influenced by environmental factors such as temperature fluctuations. Recent findings suggest that temperature-regulated alternative splicing (AS) plays a critical role in controlling the plant response to variations in temperature at the molecular level, allowing quick adaptation to the current conditions. However, AS factors in plants are largely uncharacterized. Here we describe the function of PORCUPINE (PCP), a bona fide AS regulator, which is essential for correct development of Arabidopsis thaliana at low ambient temperature and whose loss of function mutants show severe meristem defects. Our findings support a role for PCP in AS regulation and point to the misregulation of two genes involved in maintaining the shoot apical meristem stem cell fate, WUSCHEL (WUS) and CLAVATA3 (CLV3) as possible cause for the meristem defects affecting the mutants at low temperatures. In summary, we establish PCP as an important regulator of development in plants. Less...

PRJEB19936	TRB and PRC2Telobox cis-elements recruit CLF-PRC2 for H3K27me3 deposition via TELOMERE REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (TRBs) in Arabidopsis	Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) deposits the repressive epigenetic H3K27me3 mark at target genes. In plants, different mechanisms for PRC2 recruitment have only been described for individual genes. Here we provide evidence of genome-wide PRC2 recruitment by TELOMERE REPEAT BINDING FACTORs (TRBs) in connection with the telobox cis-element. A trb1/2/3 mutant displayed a severe pleiotropic phenotype with thousands of misregulated genes and a transcriptome strikingly similar to that of strong PRC2 mutants. Furthermore, TRB1-3 physically interact with CLF, the catalytic unit of PRC2. ChIP-seq data show substantial redistribution of H3K27me3 in trb1/2/3, affecting 21.78 % of all Polycomb group (PcG) target genes. Loss of H3K27me3 is correlated to gene induction, TRB1 binding, and the presence of telobox elements. Mutation of a TRB1-bound telobox caused ectopic expression and H3K27me3 depletion of a SEP3 promoter-reporter construct. We propose that teloboxes recruit PRC2 for H3K27me3 deposition through an interaction between TRBs and CLF. Less...	
PRJEB8944	TRB1TELOMERE REPEAT BINDING PROTEINS assist Polycomb Group protein complexes in the repression of target genes	In multicellular organisms, Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 1 and 2 repress target genes through chromatin compaction 1–3. Arabidopsis mutants strongly compromised in the pathway cannot develop differentiated organs, while loss of LIKE HETEROCHROMATIN PROTEIN 1 (LHP1) causes relatively mild phenotypic alterations although LHP1 is the only plant PRC1 component shown to associate genome-wide with the H3K27me3 modification set by PRC2. We screened for genetic enhancers of lhp1 mutants to identify novel components repressing target genes together with or in parallel to LHP1. Two enhancer mutations were mapped by isogenic mapping-by-sequencing to TELOMERE REPEAT BINDING PROTEIN (TRB) 1 and the paralog TRB3. ChIPseq analysis revealed that TRB1 binds to thousands of genomic sites containing cis-elements related to the telobox and that the number of binding sites as well as the enrichment at binding sites increases significantly in lhp1 mutants. RNA-seq analysis supports a model in which TRBs act as general transcriptional repressors that uphold down-regulation of Polycomb Group (PcG) target genes when chromatin-mediated repression is compromised by mutation.

PRJEB17880	Thioredoxin DCC1 regulates shoot regeneration through modulating multiple genes expression by RNA-seq analyses in Arabidopsis	The capacity of plant regeneration in different ecotypes of Arabidopsis largely varies. However, the mechanism underlying this process remains exclusive. Here, we identified a critical thioredoxin gene DCC1 in determining natural variation for shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis. Functional loss of DCC1 resulted in the repression of shoot regeneration. DCC1 encodes a thioredoxin, which was localized in mitochondria. DCC1 directly interacted with CARBONIC ANHYDRASE 2 (CA2) to regulate the mitochondrial respiratory complex Ⅰ activity and mediate the Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) level. Defects of DCC1 or CA2 caused the increased ROS level. To understand the regulatory mechanism of DCC1-mediated ROS in shoot regeneration, we analyzed the transcript levels of wild type Col-0 and the mutant dcc1 calli during shoot regeneration by RNA-seq. Three biological repeats of wild type Co-0 and the mutant dcc1 calli were used for RNA sequencing. Total RNAs were isolated from the calli of wild type Col-0 and the mutant dcc1 cultured on shoot-induction medium. The RNA-seq was performed using the Illumina Hiseq 2500. The raw reads were aligned to the genome sequences of TAIR10 using Tophat2 software. The gene expression levels were measured in FPKM, and many critical genes were identified to be involved in shoot regeneration. Less...	
PRJEB26576	RNA-seq analysis of Arabidopsis sulki1, Kas-2 and Ler/Kas-2 near isogenic line (NIL)	Progeny from a cross of Arabidopsis thaliana Landsberg (Ler, Poland) and Kashmir-2 (Kas-2, central Asia) accessions exhibit immune-related hybrid incompatibility (HI) due to a genetic interaction between a cluster of eight TNL (Toll/Interleukin1 Receptor- Nucleotide Binding - Leucine Rich Repeat) RPP1-like (Recognition of Peronospora parasitica 1-like) genes (R1- R8) from Ler and central Asian alleles of a Strubbelig-family receptor-like kinase (SRF3). In characterizing mutants altered in Ler/Kas-2 HI, we mapped multiple intragenic mutations to the RPP1-like Ler locus. The expression of sulki1 (suppressor of Ler/Kas-2 incompatibility 1) mutant mapping to RPP1-like R8 Ler, the parental line Kas-2 accession and the Ler/Kas-2 NIL have been determined by RNA-seq in 5-week old plants grown at 14 - 16 ºC.

HUB1 and HUB2 interact with two RNA-binding proteins KHD and SPEN. Phenotype analysis of the knock-down khd-1, knock-out spen-1, and knock-out hub mutants suggested that KHD and SPEN may contribute to flowering- and circadian clock-related functions that are also target of HUB1/2 activity. Transcriptome analysis was performed using RNA extracted from shoot apices of 10-day-old seedlings. After library preparation by TruSeq, RNA was sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq. Less...	
PRJEB27007	Arabidopsis RNA-Seq data upon inoculation with commensal Rhizobiales R129EModular traits of the Rhizobiales root microbiota and their evolutionary relationship with symbiotic rhizobia	Rhizobia are a paraphyletic group of soil-borne bacteria characterized by their ability to induce nodule organogenesis in legume roots and fix atmospheric nitrogen for plant growth. In non-leguminous plants, species within the Rhizobiales order define a core lineage of the plant microbiota, suggesting alternative forms of interactions with plant hosts. Genome analysis of 1,314 Rhizobiales isolates along with amplicon studies of the root microbiota showed that key symbiosis genes were acquired multiple times and that their most recent common ancestor had the capacity to colonize the roots of a broad range of hosts. We identify root growth promotion as a characteristic trait of Rhizobiales in Arabidopsis thaliana, whereas interference with the plant immune system constitutes a separate, strain-specific phenotype of root commensal Alphaproteobacteria. Using a tripartite gnotobiotic plant system, we show that these traits operate in a modular fashion and might be relevant to microbial homeostasis in healthy roots. Less...

PRJNA471967	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Transcriptome or Gene expression	We identified the role of Arabidopsis thaliana CAMTA5 in root development. The relative expression of CAMTA5 was greater in the root tissue as compared to other tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana. Two independent T-DNA insertion CAMTA5 mutants showed abrupt primary and lateral root development indicating a probable role of CAMTA5 in root architecture. The transcriptome analyses of AtCAMTA5 further strengthened the hypothesis since expression of several genes critical for root development was perturbed in the mutant. Our results indicate that CAMTA5 positively regulate calcium uptake while it negatively regulates nitrate transport in the roots. CAMTA5 also regulates ROS response in the roots as revealed by biochemical analysis and supported by our transcriptome date. Less...

PRJNA395995	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Over-expression of DNA methyltransferase MET1 in Arabidopsis generates new epi-alleles with heritable expression states	Epigenetic marks such as DNA methylation and histone modification can vary among plant accessions creating epi-alleles with different levels of expression competence. For some genetic loci, epigenetic marks are transmitted to the next generation, epigenetic changes can induce heritable changes in gene expression and phenotype. In Arabidopsis thaliana, DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE1 (MET1) controls maintenance of cytosine methylation at symmetrical CG positions. At a small number of loci, which contain dense DNA methylation in CG- and non-CG context, loss of MET1 causes joint loss of all cytosine methylation marks. As this suggests an additional role of MET1 as a coordinator for dense methylation patterns, we investigated if MET1-dependent dense methylation was also sensitive to increased MET1 levels. We find that, at certain dense methylation loci, over-expression of both catalytically active and inactive versions of MET1 generates epi-alleles with novel expression states, DNA methylation patterns and histone marks. Some of the induced epi-alleles were maintained after the MET1 transgene had been crossed out. Over-expression of MET1, which we hypothesise to cause an imbalance in MET1 binding to interactors or complexes that regulate dense methylation, offers a powerful tool to create novel epi-alleles and to investigate links between DNA methylation and gene function.

PRJNA421176	Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 cell culture replication timing, 30 min EdU pulse VE strategy	"Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 cell culture grown under constant light were pulse-labeled with the thymidine analog 5-Ethynyl-2'-deoxyuridine (EdU) for 30 minutes to allow actively replicating DNA to incorporate the EdU. The cell cultures were fixed in 1% formaldehyde for 10 minutes, washed in PBS, and snap frozen. Nuclei were isolated from the frozen cells, the incorporated EdU was ""clicked"" to Alexa Fluor-488 (AF-488), and total DNA was stained with DAPI. Nuclei were flow sorted based on EdU incorporation (AF-488 fluorescence) and DNA content (DAPI fluorescence) into early, mid and late stages of S phase. G1 nuclei were also sorted to use as a genomic DNA reference for sequencing. After DNA was isolated from the sorted nuclei, EdU/AF-488 labeled DNA was immunoprecipitated from each of the three S-phase stages using an AF-488 antibody. The resulting IP DNA from three S-phase stages, and the G1 reference genomic DNA were Illumina sequenced to generate whole-genome DNA replication timing profiles. Less..."

PRJNA376131	Spatially resolved transcriptomics in plants	Understanding complex biological systems requires functional characterization of specialized tissue domains. However, existing strategies for generating and analyzing high-throughput spatial expression profiles were developed for a limited range of organisms - primarily mammals. We present the first available approach to generate and study high-resolution, spatially-resolved functional profiles in a broad range of model plant systems. Our process includes high-throughput spatial transcriptome profiling followed by spatial gene and pathway analyses. Here we first demonstrate feasibility by generating spatial transcriptome profiles from model angiosperms and gymnosperms microsections. In Arabidopsis thaliana we use the spatial data to show differences in expression levels of 141 genes and 189 pathways among eight inflorescence tissue domains. Our combined approach of spatial transcriptomics and functional profiling represents a powerful new strategy that can be applied to a broad range of plant species, providing an approach that will be pivotal to answering fundamental questions in developmental and evolutionary biology.

PRJNA418881	Thylakoid-bound polysomes and a dynamin-related protein, FZL, mediate critical stages of the linear chloroplast biogenesis program in greening Arabidopsis cotyledons	Biogenesis of the complex 3D architecture of plant thylakoids remains an unsolved problem. We have analyzed this process in chloroplasts of germinating Arabidopsis cotyledons of wild type and two chloroplast mutants, rh3-4 and fzl plants by electron tomography, immunoelectron microscopy, immunoblot, and transcriptomic analyses of chloroplast proteins. Our study has identified a linear developmental sequence with five assembly stages: (1) tubulo-vesicular pro-thylakoids (24 HAI; hours after imbibition); (2) sheet-like pre-granal thylakoids that develop from the pro-thylakoids (36 HAI); (3) proliferation of pro-grana stacks with wide tubular connections to the originating pre-grana thylakoids (60 HAI); (4) structural differentiation of pro-grana stacks and expanded stroma thylakoids (84 HAI); (5) conversion of the pro-grana stacks into mature grana stacks (120 HAI). Development of the planar pre-granal thylakoids and of the pro-grana membrane stacks coincides with the appearance of thylakoid-bound polysomes and the assembly of photosystem II (PSII) complexes (36 HAI). This is followed at 60 HAI by the appearance of ATP synthase, cytochrome b6f and light harvesting complex II proteins. PSI proteins and the curvature-inducing CURT1A protein are the last to appear at 84 HAI. In rh3-4 plastids, in which ribosome biogenesis is delayed, pro-thylakoids accumulate until stromal ribosomes are produced, and pro-grana stacks develop after polysomes bind to the thylakoid membrane. Pro-grana stacks of fzl mutant form discrete membrane compartments with a spiral configuration instead of an organelle-wide membrane network, suggesting that FZL is involved in interconnecting thylakoid elements Less...	
PRJNA391541	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)PaMBF1c overexpressor transcriptome	Polytrichastrum alpinum is one of the moss species that survives extreme conditions in Antarctic. In order to explore the function of P. alpinum multiprotein-bridging factor 1c gene (PaMBF1c), the gene was overexpressed in Arabidopsis and the overexpression phenotypes were analyzed by comparing with the wildtype and/or the Arabidopsis own MBF1c (AtMBF1c) overexpressors. Overexpression of PaMBF1c in Arabidopsis resulted in enhanced tolerance in salt, osmotic, and cold stresses as well as heat stress. More specifically, PaMBF1c overexpressing lines showed better salt tolerance than the wild type, which was not clearly observed in the AtMBF1c overexpressing lines. To investigate these phenotype differences in wild-type Arabidopsis, PaMBF1c overexpressor, and AtMBF1c overexpressors, RNA-seq analysis was performed for these three different plants under normal condition and salt stress.

PRJNA381300	fruitENCODE: An encyclopedia of DNA elements for fruit ripening	Fleshy fruit ripening is an irreversible developmental process that the physiological and biochemical properties of the seed-bearing organ are altered to aid seed dispersal. Significant progress has been made in the model fruit tomato, in which the plant hormone ethylene, fruit specific transcription factors and epigenome reprograming fine tune the ripening processes. The complexity in ripening regulation could be of significant evolutionary advantage, as accidental activation of ripening would attract frugivores prematurely and cause unnecessary seed loss, and the relatively stable epigenome could serve as a checkpoint to prevent ripening before seed maturation. However, as fleshy fruit evolved independently in different plant lineages, it would be naive to consider the observations made in tomato could be universal. The goal of this fruit ENCODE project is to provide a comprehensive annotation of functional elements in not just the tomato genome, but a wide-range of fleshy fruit species in order to examine the diversity of fruit ripening processes.

PRJNA328771	Splicing-related genes are alternatively spliced upon changes in ambient temperatures in plants	Plants adjust their development and architecture to small variations in ambient temperature. In a time in which temperatures are rising world-wide, the mechanism by which plants are able to sense temperature fluctuations and adapt to it, is becoming of special interest. By performing RNA-sequencing on two Arabidopsis accession and one Brassica species exposed to temperature alterations, we showed that alternative splicing is an important mechanism in ambient temperature sensing and adaptation. We found that amongst the differentially alternatively spliced genes, splicing related genes are enriched, suggesting that the splicing machinery itself is targeted for alternative splicing when temperature changes. Moreover, we showed that many more components of the splicing machinery are targeted for ambient temperature regulated alternative splicing, rather than only the class of serine/arginine-rich proteins, of which environmentally induced alternative splicing has received much attention lately. Mutant analysis of a splicing related gene that was differentially spliced in two of the genotypes showed an altered flowering time response to different temperatures. We propose a two-step mechanism where temperature directly influences alternative splicing of the splicing machinery genes, followed by a second step where the altered splicing machinery affects splicing of downstream genes involved in the adaptation to altered temperatures.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, multiple regulators determine this activity. A small secreted peptide, CLAVATA3 (CLV3), functions as an important negative regulator of stem cell activity. Two transcription factors, AGAMOUS (AG) and SUPERMAN (SUP), act in different pathways to regulate the termination of floral meristem activity. To understand genes controlled by these three factors, RNA-seq was performed. Less...

PRJDB6107	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:T87 (thale cress)Genome-wide analysis of mRNA half-lives in Arabidopsis T87 cultured cell.	Gene expression in eukaryotes is modulated at multiple levels from initiation of transcription through mRNA degradation. mRNA degradation is one of the most critical steps on the gene expression (Keene J.D. 2010). In the previous study, transcriptional inhibitor (Actinomycin D) has been used to analyze mRNA degradation. However, transcriptional inhibitor has a disruptive impact on cellular physiology and disturb the precise determination of the RNA degradation rate (half-lives). Recently, genome-wide RNA decay analysis under inhibitor-free condition has been developed. Especially, 5-bromouridine (BrU) is less harmful than other method. Thus, we performed bromouridine immunoprecipitation chase (BRIC) method to determine the mRNA half-lives in Arabidopsis T87 cultured cell. Less...

PRJNA318497	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-Seq Analysis of fas5 and Dijon-M Arabidopsis thaliana young inflorescence	DNA topoisomerase TOP1α plays a specific role in Arabidopsis plants development and is required for stem cell regulation in the shoot and floral meristems. Recently, morphological features independent of meristem functioning have been described for fas5, a new mutation which leads to a premature termination of transcription and loss of a functionally significant C-terminal domain of topoisomerase I. We performed RNA sequencing to identify differentially expressed genes in the apices of young inflorescences of fas5 and Dijon-M plants to clarify the effects of fas5 on bolting initiation and flower development. This analysis showed that mutation caused changes in the expression level of 3901 genes. RNA sequencing revealed the activation of the shade avoidance response pathways in fas5 and the repression of genes controlling floral meristem identity and organ morphogenesis, thus indicating a wider TOP1α role in plant development.

PRJNA407271	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Thermoresponive small RNAs in Arabidopsis thalinana	Plants substantially alter their developmental program upon changes in the ambient temperature. The 21-24 nt small RNAs (sRNAs) are important gene expression regulators, which play a major role in development and adaptation. However, little is known about how the different sRNA classes respond to changes in the ambient temperature. We profiled the sRNA populations in four different tissues of Arabidopsis thaliana plants grown at 15, 21 and 27 °C. We found that only a small fraction (0.6%) of the sRNA loci are ambient temperature-controlled. We identified thermoresponsive miRNAs and identified their target genes using degradome libraries. We discovered that the target of the thermoregulated miR169, NF-YA2, is also ambient temperature-regulated. NF-YA2, as the component of the conserved transcriptional regulator NF-Y complex, binds the promoter of the flowering time regulator FT and the auxin biosynthesis gene YUC2. Other differentially expressed loci include thermoresponsive phased siRNA loci that target various auxin pathway genes and tRNA fragments. Furthermore, a temperature dependent 24-nt heterochromatic siRNA locus in the promoter of YUC2 may contribute to the epigenetic regulation of auxin homeostasis. This holistic approach facilitated a better understanding the role of the different sRNA classes in ambient temperature adaptation of plants. Less...

PRJNA381354	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Aluminum Oxide Nanoparticles and Aluminum Ion Leading to Distinct Physiological and Molecular Responses in Arabidopsis thaliana	"Nano-aluminium oxide (nAl2O3) is one of the most widely used nanomaterials, but the molecular toxic mechanism of nAl2O3 on plants is still not clarified completely. In this study, we compared the toxic effects of nAl2O3 and Al3+ ion at the physiological and molecular levels. The shoot weight and root weight of Arabidopsis thaliana were decrease to 57.01% and 45.15% after the Al3+ ion exposure , while nAl2O3 increased the root weight by 48.07% and length by 38.53% at the selected concentration (98 mmol/L) for 10 d exposure. Physiological research showed that the photosystem (chlorophyll fluorescence parameters down-regulated) and antioxidant system (MDA and H2O2 content up-regulated) in A. thaliana were severely injured by the Al3+ ion. Data from transcriptome analysis clarified how nAl2O3 and Al3+ ion selectively affected root development and growth. nAl2O3 stimulated root growth directly (e.g., up-regulation of the root hair-specific gene family and root development genes, POLARIS protein), or indirectly (e.g., up-regulation of N and P absorption-related genes). Conversely, Al3+ ion disturbed ion homeostasis (up-regulated Al and Cu content) and caused severe oxidative stress, thus activating the salicylic acid (SA) signaling pathway and up-regulating nitric oxide (NO)-related genes, inducing the plant defense response. However, the overproduced SA and NO (up-regulated 2.60-fold) led to the inhibition of CAT activity (down-regulation of CAT1 and CAT2 genes) and increased the H2O2 level (up-regulated 2.84-fold). Subsequently, root development-related genes (e.g., auxin induced in root cultures 1) were down-regulated. This work gives us new insight into understanding the different molecular mechanisms of the plant response to nAl2O3 and Al3+ stresses.

PRJNA382583	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Signature of coevolution between determinants of defense and life span in Arabidopsis thaliana	"The selective impact of pathogen epidemics on host defenses can be strong but remains transient. By contrast, life-history shifts can durably and continuously modify the balance between costs and benefits, which arbitrates the evolution of host defenses. Their impact, however, has seldom been documented. Here, we show with a simple mathematical model that the selective advantage of the defense system is expected to decrease with decreasing life span. We further document that, in natural populations of the model plant system Arabidopsis thaliana, the expression level of defense genes correlate positively with flowering time, a proxy for the length of vegetative life span. Using a genetic strategy to partition life span-dependent and –independent defense genes, we demonstrate that this positive co-variation is not explained by the pleiotropic action of major regulatory genes controlling both defense and life span. In agreement with our model, this study reveals that natural selection has likely assembled alleles promoting lower expression of defense genes with alleles decreasing the duration of vegetative life span in natural populations of A. thaliana. This is the first study demonstrating that life history evolution has a pervasive impact on the evolution of host immunity.

PRJNA383744	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis MOS4-associated complex promotes microRNA biogenesis and pre-mRNA splicing [RNA-seq]	"The evolutionarily conserved, putative RNA helicase MAC7 exists in both animals and plants. The human MAC7 homolog, Aquarius, is part of the spliceosome and plays a role in pre-mRNA splicing in vitro. In Arabidopsis, MAC7 was shown to be part of the MOS4-associated complex (MAC), which is required for plant defense and development. Here through RNA-seq analysis we discover that down-regulated genes in MAC subunit mutants are mostly involved in plant defense and stimulus response, confirming a role of MAC in the regulation of biotic and abiotic stress responses. We also discover global intron retention defects in mutants in three members of MAC, thus linking the functions of MAC to splicing in Arabidopsis. In addition, we show that mac7-1, a partial loss-of-function mutant in MAC7, and two other MAC subunit mutants, mac3a mac3b and prl1 prl2, exhibit reduced microRNA levels in general, indicating that MAC promotes microRNA biogenesis. The mac7-1 mutant shows reduced primary miRNA (pri-miRNA) levels without affecting MIR promoter activity or the degradation of pri-miRNA transcripts, implicating functions of MAC7 during transcription elongation or maturation of pri-miRNAs. As a nuclear protein, MAC7 is not localized in dicing bodies, but it affects the localization of HYL1 to dicing bodies. We propose that MAC acts to link MIR transcription to pri-miRNA processing.

PRJNA383872	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Salt-stress and CTD phosphatase-like 4 mediate switching of snRNA to mRNA transcription in Arabidopsis thaliana [CPL4(Oto)]	"RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain (CTD) phosphorylation regulates transcription of both protein-coding mRNAs and non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs). However, understanding about CTD-phosphoregulation in plant ncRNA transcription is still obscure.  Here we used Arabidopsis CTD phosphatase-like 4 knock-down lines (CPL4RNAi) and show that CPL4 functions in a genome-wide, conditional 3'-extensions of small nuclear RNA (snRNA) and biogenesis of novel snR-DPGs, which are protein-coding snRNA-mRNA fusion transcripts (snR-Downstream Protein-coding Gene).  Production of snR-DPG is dependent on pol II snRNA promoter (PIIsnR), and CPL4RNAi promotes readthrough of snRNA 3’-end processing signal and pol II transcription downstream of snRNA.  Also discovered was a novel unstable ncRNASSP14, which is driven by a PIIsnR and is conditionally 3'-extended to produce mRNA.  In wild type, the snRNA-to-snR-DPG switching is induced by salt stress, and is associated with alteration of CTD phosphorylation status in the transcribing pol II complex. The snR-DPG transcripts occur widely in plants, suggesting that the transcriptional snRNA-to-snR-DPG switching is a previously unknown mechanism ubiquitous in plants to regulate gene expression in response to environmental stresses.

PRJNA383997	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)High-resolution gene expression datasets of ontogenetic zones in the root apical meristem	"In plants, apical meristems allow continuous growth along the body axis. Within the root apical meristem (RAM), a group of slowly dividing quiescent center (QC) cells is thought to limit stem cell activity to directly neighboring cells (Cowels, 1956; van den Berg et al., 1997), thus endowing them with unique properties, distinct from displaced daughters. This binary identity of the stem cells stands in apparent contradiction with the more gradual changes in cell division potential (Bennett and Scheres, 2010) and differentiation (Yamaguchi et al., 2008; 2010; Furuta et al, 2014; Geldner, 2013; Masucci et al., 1996; Dolan and Costa, 2001) that occur as cells move further away from the QC. To address this paradox and to infer molecular organization of the root meristem, we used a whole-genome approach to determine dominant transcriptional patterns along root ontogeny zones. We found that the prevalent patterns are expressed in two opposing gradients. One is characterized by genes associated with development, the other enriched in differentiation genes. We confirmed these transcript gradients, and demonstrate that these translate to gradients in protein accumulation and gradual changes in cellular properties. We also show that gradients are genetically controlled through multiple pathways. Based on these findings, we propose that cells in the Arabidopsis root meristem gradually transition from ‘stemness’ towards differentiation.

Furthermore, lncRNAs targeted protein-coding genes were predicted and functional annotated. In addition, we constructed a network of interactions between ncRNAs (miRNAs, lncRNA) and mRNAs.

In eukaryotic cells, metabolites from organelles or the cytosol affect epigenetic modifications. However, the relationships between metabolites and epigenetic modifications are not well understood in plants. We found that peroxisomal acyl-CoA oxidase 4 (ACX4), an enzyme in the fatty acid β-oxidation pathway, is required for suppressing the silencing of some endogenous loci as well as Pro35S:NPTII in the ProRD29A:LUC/C24 transgenic line. The acx4 mutation reduces nuclear histone acetylation and increases DNA methylation at the NOS terminator of Pro35S:NPTII, and at some endogenous genomic loci, which are also targeted by the demethylation enzyme REPRESSOR OF SILENCING 1 (ROS1). Furthermore, mutations in multifunctional protein 2 (MFP2) and 3-ketoacyl-CoA thiolase-2 (KAT2/PED1/PKT3), two enzymes in the last two steps of the β-oxidation pathway, lead to similar patterns of DNA hypermethylation as in acx4. Thus, metabolites from fatty acid β-oxidation in peroxisomes are closely linked to nuclear epigenetic modifications, which may affect diverse cellular processes in plants.

PRJNA384596	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The developmental regulator PKL is required to maintain correct DNA methylation patterns at RNA-directed DNA methylation loci (RNA-Seq)	"Background: The chromodomain helicase DNA-binding family of ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling factors play essential roles during eukaryote growth and development. They are recruited by specific transcription factors and regulate the expression of developmentally important genes. Here, we describe an unexpected role in noncoding RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Results: Through forward genetic screens we identified PKL, a gene required for developmental regulation in plants, as a factor promoting transcriptional silencing at the transgenic RD29A promoter. Mutation of PKL results in DNA methylation changes at more than half of the loci that are targeted by RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). A small number of transposable elements and genes had reduced DNA methylation correlated with derepression in the pkl mutant, though for the majority, decreases in DNA methylation are not sufficient to cause release of silencing. The changes in DNA methylation in the pkl mutant are positively correlated with changes in 24-nt siRNA levels. In addition, PKL is required for the accumulation of Pol V-dependent transcripts and for the positioning of Pol V-stabilized nucleosomes at several tested loci, indicating that RNA polymerase V-related functions are impaired in the pkl mutant.
Conclusions: PKL is required for transcriptional silencing and has significant effects on RdDM in plants. The changes in DNA methylation in the pkl mutant are correlated with changes in the noncoding RNAs produced by Pol IV and Pol V. We propose that at RdDM target regions, PKL may be required to create a chromatin environment that influences noncoding RNA production, DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing.

In metazoans, the U1 snRNP, which binds to 5’ splice sites, also fulfills regulatory roles in splice site selection and possesses non-splicing related functions. Here, we show that an Arabidopsis U1 snRNP subunit, LUC7, affects constitutive and alternative splicing. Interestingly, LUC7 specifically promotes splicing of a subset of terminal introns. Splicing of LUC7-dependent terminal introns is a prerequisite for nuclear export and can be modulated by stress. Globally, intron retention under stress conditions occurs preferentially among first and terminal introns, uncovering an unknown bias for splicing regulation in Arabidopsis. Taken together, our study reveals that the Arabidopsis U1 snRNP is important for alternative splicing and removal of terminal introns and it suggests that Arabidopsis terminal introns fine-tune gene expression under stress conditions.

Since 2008, whole-genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) has become the gold standard for DNA methylation analysis and a tremendous amount of WGBS data has been generated by the research community. However, methods for the systematic comparison of DNA methylation profiles to identify novel regulatory mechanisms have yet to be established.Results: Here we developed a standardized pipeline and re-analyzed over three hundred publicly available Arabidopsis WGBS libraries from various mutant backgrounds, tissue types, and stress treatments. In total this collection included more than 3,700 Gb (Giga base-pairs) of sequencing data and a large number of wild-type controls. This enabled us to identify “high-confidence Differentially Methylated Regions” (hcDMRs) with high reliability by comparing each ‘test’ library to each of the 54 controls. We adopted two statistical methods, Statistical Measurements on Overlapping of DMRs (S-MOD) followed by Quantitative Measurements on Overlapping of DMRs (Q-MOD), to compare and cluster libraries based on their impacts on DNA methylation. In addition to confirming existing relationships using this unbiased approach, we revealed novel connections between methylation pathways. For instance, MET1 and CMT3 were found to be required for maintenance of asymmetric CHH methylation at non-overlapping regions of CMT2 targeted heterochromatin.Conclusions: Our comparative methylome approach has established a framework for extracting biological insights via large-scale comparison of methylomes, and can also be adopted for other omics datasets.

"Alternative splicing (AS) plays key roles in plant development and responses to environmental changes. However, the mechanisms underlying AS divergence (differential expression of transcript isoforms resulting from alternative splicing) in plant accessions and its contributions to responses to environmental stimuli remain unclear. In this study, we investigated genome-wide variation of AS in Arabidopsis thaliana accessions Col-0, Bur-0, C24, Kro-0, and Ler-1, as well as their F1 hybrids, and characterized the regulatory mechanisms for AS divergence by RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). We found that most of the divergent AS events in Arabidopsis accessions were cis-regulated by sequence variation, including those in core splice site and splicing motifs. Many genes that differed in AS between Col-0 and Bur-0 were involved in stimulus responses. Further genome-wide association analyses of 22 environmental variables showed that SNPs influencing known splice site strength were also associated with environmental stress responses. These results demonstrate that cis-variation in genomic sequences among Arabidopsis accessions was the dominant contributor to AS divergence, and it may contribute to differences in environmental responses among Arabidopsis accessions.

Jasmonate signaling is one of the major endogenous hormone signals to induced leaf senescence in Arabidopsis. However, whether circadian clock will gate Jasmonate signaling to induce leaf senescence and the underlying precise mechanism is unclear. Here we find that the Evening Complex (EC) of core oscillator closely regulates leaf senescence. To identify the underlying mechanism of EC regulating leaf senescence, we conducted RNA-sequencing. Transcriptomic data reveals Evening complex extensively involves into JA signal transduction and responses. Moreover, the mutants of ELF3, ELF4 and LUX universly display the accelerated JA-induced leaf senescence phenotype, while their overexpression lines act reversely. In accordance with the transcript levels of JA immediate early induced JA-responsive gene MYC2 are up-regulated in lux mutants. Futhermore we demonstrated LUX can bind to to the promoter of MYC2 in vivo to represses its transcription. In addition, the accelerated JA-induced leaf senescence in mutants of evening complex can be overturned by myc2, myc3 and myc4 mutants redundantly. Collectively, our findings demonstrated the underlying molecular basis for circadian clock gating jasmonate signaling to induce leaf senescence through the module of evening complex to directly repressing MYC2 transcription. This novel established molecular module also refines complicated nodes between circadian clock and jasmonate signal in Arabidopsis.

To investigate enhancers in Arabidopsis thaliana, we analyzed the chromatin landscape, RNA Pol II occupancy, and the polyadenylated and non-polyadenylated Arabidopsis transcriptomes, using exosome-deficient lines to capture stable and unstable transcripts.
Here we identified the set of unique >1900 regions, termed Putative Enhancers (PEs), carrying canonical chromatin signatures of metazoan transcriptional enhancers.
Almost of PEs are intra-genic and transcriptionally active. Unexpectedly, most of the PE carrying these signatures are associated with the 3′ ends of protein-coding genes, enriched in transcription factor binding, with binding motifs resembling polyadenylation signals, thus linking links two hubs of very different, functionally and mechanistically distinct processes – cleavage/polyadenylation and transcription termination of protein-coding genes with transcriptional activation/regulation of different genes. And may present a novel DNA elements with regulatory potential.
Additionally, according to high resolution Arabidopsis Hi-C data 24% of identified PEs interact with other protein-coding genes intrachromosomally, through binding by the same set of transcription factors, supporting the notion of co-regulation of expression between PEs and their targets. We also confirmed that PEs are highly conserved in the recently sequenced 1035 different Arabidopsis accessions.
Overall design: Identifications and characterization of a novel putative intragenic enhancers (PEs) in Arabidopsis. To determine if the identified PEs are actively transcribed we profiled the RNA expression in WT and the exosome deficient Arabidopsis seedlings. Since eRNAs (transcripts arising at enhancer locus) varied by their polyadenylation status, we collected both the polyadenylated RNAs (polyA(+)) and the pool of ribo-minus RNA depleted of rRNAs to increase our detection for non-polyadenylated RNA, and subjected to high throughout sequencing.

PRJNA388950	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Exploring the link between ER stress and autophagy in Arabidopsis	"Autophagy is a conserved process in eukaryotes that contributes to cell survival in response to stress. Previously, we found that ER stress induces autophagy in a manner dependent upon IRE1b, an ER membrane-associated factor involved in the splicing of bZIP60 mRNA. IRE1 is a dual protein kinase and ribonuclease, and here we studied the involvement of the protein kinase catalytic domain, nucleotide binding and RNase domains of IRE1b in activating autophagy.  Autophagy was assessed by quantifying the numbers of autophagosomes in transgenic Arabidopsis seedlings bearing mutations in the various IRE1b domains. The results showed that nucleotide binding and RNase activity of IRE1b are required for ER stress-mediated autophagy.  The RNase activity is involved in IRE1b’s mRNA splicing function, but its principal splicing target, bZIP60, is not involved in IRE1b’s activation of autophagy. We therefore considered other roles for IRE1b in the activation of autophagy.  Clustering of ER localized IRE1b-YFP was observed when seedlings were subjected to ER stress, and so we investigated whether IRE1b clustering induced autophagy. However, the RNase knockout mutation in IRE1b still undergoes clustering, suggesting that IRE1b clustering does not induce autophagy. In response to ER stress, the RNase of IRE1 has been found to engage in another activity called Regulated Ire1-Dependent Decay of Messenger RNA (RIDD), which is the promiscuous degradation of other mRNA in response to ER stress.  By analyzing the RNA-seq data, 12 RIDD target genes were picked up for testing their role in inhibiting autophagy, and glucosidase 21 and peroxidase 14 are proved to be degraded to support the induction of autophagy by ER stress.

In this work, we characterize DXO1, the Arabidopsis thaliana DXO homolog. We demonstrate that the plant-specific modification within the active site negatively affects 5'-end capping surveillance properties of DXO1, but has only a minor impact on its strong deNADding activity. Unexpectedly, catalytic activity does not contribute to striking morphological and molecular aberrations observed upon DXO1 knockout in plants, which include growth and pigmentation deficiency, global transcriptomic changes and accumulation of RNA quality control siRNAs. Conversely, these phenotypes depend on the plant-specific N-terminal extension of DXO1. Pale-green coloration of DXO1-deficient plants and our RNA-seq data reveal that DXO1 affects chloroplast-localized processes. We propose that DXO1 mediates the connection between RNA turnover and retrograde chloroplast-to-nucleus signaling independently of its deNADding properties.

However, the molecular mechanism of how NPC regulates abiotic stress responses, especially the expression of stress responsive genes remains poorly understood. From a forward genetics screen using an abiotic stress-responsive luciferase reporter (RD29A-LUC) in the sickle-1 (sic-1) mutant background, we identified a suppressor caused by a mutation in NUCLEOPORIN 85 (NUP85), which exhibited reduced expression of RD29A-LUC in response to ABA and salt stress. Consistently, the ABA and salinity induced expression of several stress responsive genes such as RD29A, COR15A and COR47 was significantly compromised in nup85 mutants and other nucleoporin mutants such as nup160 and hos1. Subsequently, Immunoprecipitation and mass spectrometry analysis revealed that NUP85 is potentially associated with HOS1 and other nucleoporins within the nup107-160 complex, along with several mediator subunits. We further showed that there is a direct physical interaction between MED18 and NUP85. Similar to NUP85 mutations, MED18 mutation was also found to attenuate expression of stress responsive genes. Taken together, we not only revealed the involvement of NUP85 and other nucleoporins in regulating ABA and salt stress responses, but also uncovered a potential relation between NPC and mediator complex in modulating the gene expression in plants.

PRJNA389308	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Locus-specific control of the de novo DNA methylation pathway [mRNA-seq]	"Abstract: Cytosine DNA methylation plays crucial roles in gene regulation, transposon silencing, and diverse developmental processes. While methylation patterns are known to differ between cell-types, tissues, and disease states, how these differences arise remains poorly understood. In plants, DNA methylation is established via the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway (RdDM), wherein 24-nucleotide small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) guide methylation at cognate genomic loci1. RNA POLYMERASE-IV (Pol-IV), a plant-specific polymerase, initiates the biogenesis of these methylation-targeting RNAs, thus understanding how Pol-IV is regulated is critical in determining how specific patterns of DNA methylation are generated. Here we show roles for four Pol-IV-associated factors, CLASSY (CLSY) 1-42,3, in both locus-specific and global regulation of Pol-IV function. Individually, each CLSY protein controls siRNA production and Pol-IV chromatin association at unique set of loci. This translates into locus-specific DNA methylation losses and the release of silencing. In addition to locus-specific effects, several layers of redundancy were identified: The clsy1,2 and clsy3,4 mutants act synergistically, regulating thousands more siRNA loci than the single mutants. Furthermore, the clsy1,2- and clsy3,4-dependent loci are mutually exclusive and geographically distinct, revealing a striking division of labor amongst the CLSY family. Finally, the clsy quadruple mutant causes global siRNA losses, demonstrating that Pol-IV is completely dependent on the CLSY family. Investigation into the mechanisms underlying the CLSY specificity revealed connections between clsy1,2- and clsy3,4-dependent loci and either SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 or DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1, demonstrating a reliance on different chromatin modifications, H3K9 or CG DNA methylation, respectively4,5. Together, these findings not only shed light on Pol-IV function, but also reveal an additional layer of complexity to the RdDM pathway that enables the locus-specific control of DNA methylation patterns. Given the parallels between methylation systems in plants and mammals1, these findings will be informative for analogous processes in a broad range of organisms.

PRJNA389787	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Spatial control of gene expression by miR319-regulated TCP transcription factors in leaf development	"The characteristic leaf shapes we see in all plants are in good part outcome of the combined action of several transcription factor networks that translate into cell division activity during the early development of the organ. We show here that wild-type leaves have distinct transcriptomic profiles in center and marginal regions. Certain transcripts are enriched in margins, including those of CINCINNATA-like TCPs, and members of the NGATHA (NGA) and STYLISH (STY) gene families. We study in detail the contribution of miR319 regulated TCP (Teosinte branched, Cycloidea, PCF1/2) transcription factors to the development of the center and marginal regions of Arabidopsis leaves. We compare in molecular analyses wildtype, a tcp2 tcp4 mutant that has enlarged flat leaves and a tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10 mutant with strongly crinkled leaves. The different leaf domains of the tcp mutants show changed expression patterns for many photosynthesis related genes, indicating delayed differentiation, especially in the marginal parts of the organ. At the same time, we found an upregulation of cyclin genes and other genes that are known to participate in cell division, specifically in the marginal regions of tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10. Using GUS reporter constructs we confirmed extended mitotic activity in the tcp2 tcp3 tcp4 tcp10 leaf which persisted in small defined foci in the margins when the mitotic activity had already ceased in wild-type leaves. Our results describe the role of miR319-regulated TCP transcription factors in the coordination of activities in different leaf domains during the organs development.

Despite this basic cellular function, the Arabidopsis nrp1-1 nrp2-1 knock out mutant has been reported to exhibit only relatively mild seedling root phenotypes and to significantly affect the expression of only few hundred genes (Zhu et al., 2006). Here we report that NRP loss-of-function as well as the ectopic overexpression of At NRP1 significantly affected the growth, development, and the pathogen response of Arabidopsis plants under short day conditions. The nrp1-1 nrp2-1 mutant grew faster and flowered weeks earlier than the wild type and the overexpressor. The latter developed slower and flowered at a lower number of leaves than the mutant and the wild type. Moreover, the mutant was more sensitive, the overexpressor was more tolerant to pathogen infection correlating with their more adult and juvenile character, respectively. Transcriptomic comparison of mature non-bolting plants agreed with the phenotypes. The presented and published data indicate that although NRPs might not be absolutely required for plant growth and development, they contribute to the epigenetic coordination of metabolic, growth, defence and developmental processes during adaptation.

PRJNA328101	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Paternal easiRNAs establish the triploid block in Arabidopsis	"Polyploidy, the presence of more than two sets of chromosomes within the nucleus, is a common phenomenon among plants that has shaped genome organization and is thought to be a major driver of speciation. The triploid block acts as a reproductive barrier that prevents successful backcrosses of newly formed polyploids with their progenitors. It is established in the endosperm, an ephemeral tissue that nurtures the developing embryo. Here we show that paternal 21/22 nucleotide epigenetically activated small interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) in Arabidopis thaliana are responsible for the establishment of the triploid block associated seed abortion. This dramatic phenotype is overcome when crosses are performed with a paternal mutant in the plant specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV). Loss of Pol IV reduces both easiRNAs and hetsiRNAs in the pollen grain. Seeds derived from crosses between wild type tetraploid fathers and diploid mothers have reduced levels of hetsiRNAs and cytosine methylation at transposable elements (TEs), indicating that they have suffered an excess of epigenetic reprogramming due to an excess of paternally derived easiRNAs. Paternal Pol IV mutants are able to buffer that easiRNA excess and rescue the abortion phenotype by rescuing both the cytosine methylation level at TEs and the 24 nt hetsiRNA accumulation levels. This mechanism highlights the elegant and important TE regulation mechanism controlled by the plant specific Pol IV that takes place pre-fertilization and regulates paternal easiRNAs and maternal hetsiRNAs, and determines the post-fertilization epigenetic stability and seed viability.
Overall design: 15 small RNA sequencing libraries, 8 genome-wide cytosine methylation libraries and 8 RNA-seq libraries. 7 small RNA libraries were generated from mature pollen grains of diploid and tetraploid Col-0 wt and nrpd1a mutants (1n and 2n pollen, respectively) and Col-0 wt and the mutant backgrounds dcl4 rdr6 and rdr6. 8 small RNA libraries were generated from seeds at 6 days after pollination from the cross of maternal Ler with paternal Col-0 wt and the mutant backgrounds osd1,nrpd1a, and nrpd1a osd1. 8 cytosine methylation libraries were generated from hand-dissected endosperm at 6-7 days after pollination from the cross of maternal Ler with paternal Col-0 wt and the mutant backgrounds osd1,nrpd1a, and nrpd1a osd1. 8 RNA-seq libraries were generated from hand-dissected endosperm at 6-7 days after pollination from the cross of maternal Ler with paternal Col-0 wt and the mutant backgrounds osd1,nrpd1a, and nrpd1a osd1.

In this study we combined the transcriptome analysis with quantitative hormonal analysis to investigate how wounding induces callus formation in Arabidopsis thaliana. Our time-course RNA-seq analysis revealed that wounding induces dynamic transcriptional changes that can be categorized into five clusters with distinct temporal patterns. Gene ontology analyses uncovered that wounding modifies the expression of hormone biosynthesis and response genes, and quantitative analysis of endogenous plant hormones revealed accumulation of cytokinin prior to callus formation. Mutants defective in cytokinin synthesis and signalling display reduced efficiency in callus formation, indicating that de novo synthesis of cytokinin has major contribution in wound-induced callus formation. We further demonstrate that type-A ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR (ARR)-mediated cytokinin signalling regulates the expression of CYCLIN D3;1 (CYCD3;1) and mutations in CYCD3;1 and its homologs CYCD3;2-3 cause defects in callus formation.

PRJNA395456	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)LHP1 interacts with ATRX through plant-specific domains at specific loci targeted by PRC2	"Heterochromatin Protein 1 (HP1) is a major regulator of chromatin structure and function. In animals, the network of proteins interacting with HP1 is mainly associated with constitutive heterochromatin marked by H3K9me3. HP1 physically interacts with the putative orthologue of the SNF2 chromatin remodeler ATRX, which controls deposition of the histone variant H3.3 in mammals. In Arabidopsis thaliana, we show that the orthologue of ATRX participates in H3.3 deposition and characterize the function of conserved domains of plant ATRX. We show that the plant Like HP1 (LHP1) interacts with ATRX through domains that evolved specifically in land plants ancestors. Interaction between ATRX and LHP1 affects the expression of a limited subset of genes controlled by the POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX 2 (PRC2), including the flowering time regulator FLC. In the context of flowering time, ATRX function requires the novel LHP1-interacting domain and the ATPase of the ATRX SNF2 helicase. We conclude that distinct evolutionary pathways led to interaction between ATRX and HP1 in mammals or its counterpart LHP1 in plants, resulting in distinct modes of transcriptional regulation.

Mutations in PWR showed severe attenuation in high temperature associated phenotypes viz., temperature-induced hypocotyl elongation, petiole elongation and early flowering. The study involved analysing the impact of the loss of PWR on the transcriptome in response to changes in ambient temperature. About one hundred 6 day old seedlings of wild type (Col-0) and pwr-2 mutant (in Col-0 background) were grown at 23 °C in short days (SD) photoperiod in growth chambers (GR-36, Percival Scientific, Canada). Half of the samples were then shifted to 27°C under short day photoperiod. Total RNA was extracted from whole seedlings grown at 23 °C and 27°C after two hours. Two biological replicates were used for Col-0 and pwr-2 samples. RNA was extracted using Isolate II RNA plant kit (Bioline Pty Ltd, Australia).

PRJNA395664	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Primed primary metabolism in systemic leaves: a functional systems analysis	"During their co-evolution, plants have learned to counteract bacterial infection by preparing yet uninfected tissues for an enhanced defence response, the so-called systemic acquired resistance or priming response. Primed leaves express a wide range of genes that enhance the defence response once an infection takes place. While hormone-driven defence signalling and generation of defensive metabolites has been well studied, less focus has been set on the reorganization of primary metabolism in systemic leaves. Since primary metabolism plays an essential role for fuelling and optimizing defences in terms of providing energy and chemical building blocks, we investigated medium-term primed changes in primary metabolism at RNA and metabolite levels in systemic leaves of Arabidopsis thaliana plants that were locally infected with Pseudomonas syringae. While known defence genes were still activated 3-4 days after infection, we also found several parts of primary metabolism to be significantly altered. Nitrogen (N)-metabolism and content of amino acids and other N-containing metabolites were significantly reduced, whereas the organic acids fumarate and malate were strongly increased. We suggest that reduction of N-metabolites in systemic, yet non-infected leaves primes defence against bacterial infection by reducing the nutritional value of systemic tissue. The increased organic acids serve as a quickly available metabolic resource of energy and carbon-building blocks for the production of defence metabolites during subsequent secondary infections.

PRJNA395998	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Regulatory DNA in A. thaliana can tolerate high levels of sequence divergence	"Variation in regulatory DNA is thought to drive evolution. Cross-species comparisons of regulatory DNA have provided evidence for both weak purifying selection and substantial turnover in regulatory regions. However, disruption of transcription factor binding sites can affect the expression of neighboring genes. Thus, the base-pair level functional annotation of regulatory DNA has proven challenging. Here, we explore regulatory DNA variation and its functional consequences in genetically diverse strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana, which largely maintain the positional homology of regulatory DNA. Using chromatin accessibility to delineate regulatory DNA genome-wide, we find that 15% of approximately 50,000 regulatory sites varied in accessibility among strains. Some of these accessibility differences are associated with extensive underlying sequence variation, encompassing many deletions and dramatically hypervariable sequence. For the majority of such regulatory sites, nearby gene expression was similar, despite this large genetic variation. However, among all regulatory sites, those with both high levels of sequence variation and differential chromatin accessibility are the most likely to reside near genes with differential expression among strains. Unexpectedly, the vast majority of regulatory sites that differed in chromatin accessibility among strains show little variation in the underlying DNA sequence, implicating variation in upstream regulators.

PRJNA397381	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)A Tripartite Amplification Loop Involving WRKY75, Salicylic Acid and ROS Accelerates Leaf Senescence in Arabidopsis	"Leaf senescence is a highly coordinated and complicated process with the integration of numerous internal and environmental signals. Salicylic acid (SA) and reactive oxygen species (ROS) are two well-defined inducers of leaf senescence, whose contents progressively and inter-dependently increase during leaf senescence via a yet unknown mechanism. Here, we have characterized a newly identified positive regulator of leaf senescence, WRKY75, and demonstrated that knock-down or knock-out of WRKY75 delays, while over-expression of WRKY75 accelerates age-dependent leaf senescence. The WRKY75 transcription is induced by age, SA, H2O2, as well as multiple plant hormones. Meanwhile, WRKY75 is able to promote SA production by inducing the transcription of SA INDUCTION-DEFICIENT 2 (SID2), and suppress H2O2 scavenging partly by repressing the transcription of CATALASE 2 (CAT2). Genetic analysis reveals that the SID2 mutation or an increase of catalase activity rescues the precocious leaf senescence phenotype evoked by WRKY75 over-expression. Based on these results, we propose a “tripartite amplification loop” model in which WRKY75, SA and ROS undergo a gradual but self-sustained rise driven by three interlinked positive feedback regulations. This tripartite amplification loop provides a molecular framework connecting the upstream signals, such as age, ethylene, JA and ABA, to the downstream regulatory network executed by those SA-responsive and H2O2-responsive transcription factors during leaf senescence.
Overall design: We performed transcriptome profiles analysis of 28-day-old Col-0 and WRKY75RNAi leaves by RNA-seq.

PRJNA399182	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide analysis of transcription, H2A.Z, nucleosomes and HSF1 dynamics in response to temperature increase in Arabidopsis thaliana [RNA-Seq III]	"Plants are sessile organisms and therefore must sense and respond to changes of their surrounding conditions such as ambient temperature, which vary diurnally and seasonally. It is not yet clear how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development. We have previously shown that H2A.Z-nucleosomes are evicted in response to warmer temperatures. It is not clear however, whether the link between transcriptional responsiveness and changes in H2A.Z binding in context of temperature shifts is a global trend that can be seen throughout the genome, or the phenomenon is specific to a specialised set of temperature-responsive genes. In addition to the role of H2A.Z-nucleosome dynamics in the transcriptional response to temperature, it was shown that genes strongly misregulated in the h2a.z mutant are enriched for gene categories involved in response to multiple environmental cues. This suggests that H2A.Z could be implicated in the transcriptional response to various environmental inputs, raising the question: What brings the specificity of H2A.Z dynamics in response to temperature? To address this question we have profiled H2A.Z-nucleosome occupancy genome wide (using ChIP-seq) during a time course after temperature variation and compared its dynamics to transcriptional changes. We identified a fast, targeted and transient eviction of H2A.Z associated with transcriptional activation in response to temperature for a few hundreds genes. This eviction is associated with a reduction of the stability of the nucleosome. Moreover the genes with a fast H2A.Z eviction were strongly enriched in heat shock elements in their promoter and we observed a strong association between HSF1 binding and H2AZ eviction at warm temperature. These results highlight the importance of the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin to allow a controlled and dynamics response to temperature.

In this work, we show that the desert endophytic bacterium Enterobacter sp. SA187 enhances yield and biomass of alfalfa in field trials, revealing a high potential for improving desert agriculture. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we studied SA187 interaction with Arabidopsis thaliana. SA187 colonized surface and inner tissues of Arabidopsis roots and shoots and conferred tolerance to salt and osmotic stresses. Transcriptome, genetic and pharmacological studies revealed that the ethylene signaling pathway plays a key role in mediating SA187-triggered abiotic stress tolerance to plants. While plant ethylene production is not required, our data suggest that SA187 induces abiotic stress tolerance by bacterial production of 2-keto-4-methylthiobutyric acid (KMBA), known be converted into ethylene in planta. These results reveal a part of the complex molecular communication process during beneficial plant-microbe interactions and unravel an important role of ethylene in protecting plants under abiotic stress conditions.

Although phytohormones cytokinin and auxin interact to coordinately regulate many aspects of plant development, whether, if so how, cytokinin and auxin function in FM determinacy remain unclear. Here we show that the homeostasis of cytokinin is critical for the FM determinacy. Auxin promotes the expression of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR3 (ARF3) to repress cytokinin activity in FM determinacy. We found that ARF3 represses the expression of the ISOPENTENYLTRANSFERASE (IPT) family genes directly and the LONELY GUY (LOG) family genes indirectly, whose products are enzymes required for cytokinin biosynthesis. Furthermore, ARF3 directly inhibits the expression of ARABIDOPSIS HISTIDINE KINASE4 (AHK4), one of cytokinin receptor genes, to depress cytokinin activity. Genome-Wide Transcriptional Profiling reveals multiple functions of ARF3 in flower development. Consequently, ARF3 controls cell division by regulating cell cycle genes expression through cytokinin. Eventually, we show that AGAMOUS (AG) dynamically regulates the expression of ARF3 and IPTs resulting in coordinated regulation of FM maintenance and termination through cell division. Therefore, our findings reveal the molecular linkage between phytohormones auxin/cytokinin and AG in FM determinacy and shed light on the mechanisms of FM maintenance and termination.

In this study, we provide evidence that Topo VI acts as a chromatin barrier between chromatin territories by interacting with methionine adenosyltransferases (MAT), which produce the universal donor of methyl groups S-adenosyl-methionine (SAM). We first show that pericentromeric transposable elements (TEs) are awakened whereas  euchromatic island genes (EIGs) within heterochromatin are downregulated in mutants of the Topo VI complex. Consistent with this, the level of repressive H3K9me2 marks increases at EIGs loci while it decreases at TEs in a hypomorphic Topo VI mutant. We demonstrate that the Topo VI complex can interact with the SAM synthase MAT3 and drives it to TEs. A deficiency of Topo VI induces relocation of MAT3 from TEs to EIGs islands, leading to the levelling of the H3K9me2 mark and hence heterochromatin spreading.

PRJNA407986	Analysis of the translational landscape of Arabidopsis mitochondria (thale cress)	"Messenger RNA translation is a complex process that is still poorly understood in eukaryotic organelles like mitochondria. Growing evidence indicate though that mitochondrial translation differs from its bacterial counterpart in many key aspects. In this analysis, we used the ribosome profiling technology to generate a genome-wide snapshot view of mitochondrial translation in Arabidopsis. We show that, unlike in humans, most Arabidopsis mitochondrial ribosomes footprints measure 27 and 28 bases. We also reveal that respiratory subunits encoding mRNAs show much higher ribosome association than other mitochondrial mRNAs, implying that they are translated to higher levels. Homogenous ribosome densities were generally detected within each respiratory complex except for complex V where higher ribosome coverage corroborate with higher needs in specific subunits. In complex I respiratory mutants, a slight reorganization of mitochondrial mRNAs ribosome association was detected involving an increase in ribosome densities on certain ribosomal protein encoding transcripts and a reduction in the translation of a few complex V mRNAs. Altogether, our observations reveal that plant mitochondrial translation is a dynamic process and that translational control is important for gene expression in plant mitochondria. This study paves the way for future advances in the understanding of translation in higher plant mitochondria.

PRJNA408168	CPL4 is a suppressor of de novo shoot organogenesis from roots of Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"De novo shoot organogenesis (DNSO) is a commonly used pathway for plant biotechnology, and is a hormonally regulated process, where auxin and cytokinin coordinates suites of genes encoding transcription factors, general transcription factors, and RNA metabolism machinery genes. Here we report that silencing Arabidopsis thaliana CTD phosphatase-like 4 (CPL4RNAi), which increases phosphorylation level of RNA polymerase II (pol II) CTD, altered lateral root development and DNSO efficiency of the host plants, suggesting an importance of precise control of pol II activities during DNSO. Under standard condition, roots of CPL4RNAi lines produced no or few lateral roots. When induced by high concentration of auxin, CPL4RNAi lines failed to produce focused auxin maxima at the meristem of lateral root primordia, and produced fasciated lateral roots. By contrast, root explants of CPL4RNAi lines were highly competent for DNSO. Efficient DNSO of CPL4RNAi lines were observed even under 10 times less cytokinin required for wild type explants. Transcriptome analysis showed CPL4RNAi but not wild type explants expressed high levels of shoot meristem related genes during priming by high auxin/cytokinin ratio, and subsequent shoot induction with cytokinin.

PRJNA408295	Cell layer specific and polysome associated RNA from Arabidopsis thaliana Col0 and hyl1 mutant roots. (thale cress)	"microRNAs (miRNA’s) regulation target gene expression, often transcription factors and as such control entire transcriptional networks. This control is important for various developmental transitions and stress responses in a wide range of eukaryotic organisms. While miRNA-mediated gene regulation has been investigated over time (temporal) and in whole organs or tissues in multiple different organisms highlighting their importance, there has been a distinct lack of focus on spatial resolution of miRNA biology. Here we present at cell-type specific resolution, miRNA loading and miRNA action within the Arabidopsis root. Our results for the first time demonstrate the multiple novel modes of miRNA action and illustrate the widespread nature of miRNA movement, at a genome scale within a complex eukaryotic organ.

PRJNA411817	Comparison between ethylene signaling regulated transcriptome with glucose-TOR  or glucose-HXK1 regulated  transcriptome (thale cress)	"There are two principal mechanisms underlie sugar perception and signal transduction in biological systems. Direct sensing and signaling is triggered by sugar direct binding sensors such as Hexokiase 1 (HXK1) with a broad range of affinity and specificity, and indirect sensing signaling via a variety of energy and metabolite sensor, such as Target of Rapamycin (TOR). To investigate the intertwined interaction between glucose and plant hormones ethylene, the transcriptome regulated by ethylene, glucose-TOR, and glucose-HXK1 were analyzed and compared. Our results unexpectedly revealed a deep antagonistic interaction between glucose-TOR-energy signaling and the plant stress hormone ethylene.
Overall design: For ethylene related mRNA-seq, 4-day-old Col-0 seedlings were treated with 10 μM ACC for 2 hours and 4 hours. Non-treated seedlings were used as a control.

PRJNA412513	Nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning of ARF proteins controls auxin responses in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"The phytohormone auxin plays crucial roles in nearly every aspect of plant growth and development. The AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR (ARF) family of transcription factors regulates auxin-responsive gene expression and exhibit nuclear localization in regions of high auxin responsiveness. Here we show that activating ARF7 and ARF19 proteins accumulate in micron-sized assemblies within the cytoplasm of tissues with attenuated auxin responsiveness. The intrinsically disordered middle region and the folded PB1 interaction domain of ARFs drive protein assembly formation. Mutation of a single lysine within the PB1 domain abrogates cytoplasmic assemblies, promotes ARF nuclear localization, and results in an altered transcriptome and morphological defects. Our data suggest a model in which ARF nucleo-cytoplasmic partitioning regulates auxin responsiveness, thus providing a mechanism for cellular competence for auxin signaling.

PRJNA413141	Verticillium dahliae-Arabidopsis interaction causes changes in gene expression profiles and jasmonate levels on different time scales	"Verticillium dahliae is a soil-borne vascular pathogen that causes severe wilt symptoms in a wide range of plants. Co-culture of the fungus with Arabidopsis roots for 24 hours induces many changes in the gene expression profiles of both partners, even before defense-related phytohormone levels are induced in the plant. Both partners reprogram sugar and amino acid metabolism, activate genes for signal perception and transduction, and induce defense and stress responsive genes. Furthermore, analysis of Arabidopsis expression profiles suggests a redirection from growth to defense. The plant and fungal genes that rapidly respond to the presence of the partner might be crucial for early recognition steps and the future development of the interaction. Thus they are potential targets for the control of V. dahliae-induced wilt diseases.
Overall design: The aim of this study was to identify important targets regulated in both partners in the initial phase of interaction (24h). After 24 h of co-cultivation the fungus colonizes the plant root and first penetration of plant tissue by the fungus is visible while the vascular tissue of the plant is not yet colonized (pre-vascular phase).

PRJNA380344	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)DDM1/Lsh remodelers allow methylation of DNA wrapped in nucleosomes	"Eukaryotic DNA is wrapped around histone octamers to form nucleosomes, which are separated by linker DNA bound by histone H1. In many species, the DNA exhibits methylation of CG dinucleotides, which is epigenetically inherited via a semiconservative mechanism. How methyltransferases access DNA within nucleosomes remains mysterious. Here we show that methylation of nucleosomes requires DDM1/Lsh nucleosome remodelers in Arabidopsis thaliana and mouse. We also show that removal of histone H1, which partially restores methylation in ddm1 mutants, does so primarily in the linker DNA between nucleosomes. In h1ddm1 compound mutants, substantial portions of the genome exhibit dramatically periodic methylation that approaches wild-type levels in linker DNA but is virtually absent in nucleosomes. We also present evidence that de novo methylation supplements semiconservative maintenance of CG methylation across generations. Overall, our results demonstrate that nucleosomes and H1 are barriers to DNA methylation, which are overcome by DDM1/Lsh nucleosome remodelers.
Overall design: Bisulfite sequencing to determine single-base DNA methylation: 4 different genotypes from F4 generation, without replicates; MNase sequencing to identify nucleosome positions genomewide: single generation in leaf tissue for 4 different genotypes, 2 or 3 biological replicates; RNA-seq to define expression deciles in wild-type: single generation in leaf tissue for WT, 2 replicates.

PRJNA414048	Pumilio-Homology Domain protein APUM9 regulates seed dormancy via decapping-dependent mRNA decay (thale cress)	"APUM9 is a conserved PUF RNA-binding protein (RBP) and the expression of this protein is under complex epigenetic regulation. A transposable element (TE)-mediates this epigenetic regulation and thereby restricts its expression in Arabidopsis.   Currently, little is known about the molecular function of the APUM protein family and the biological relevance of the TE-mediated epigenetic control of APUM9 in plant development and stress responses.  By combining a range of transient assays, we show here that APUM9 binding to target transcripts can trigger their rapid decay via its conserved C-terminal RNA-binding domain. APUM9 directly interacts with DCP2, the catalytic subunits of the decapping complex suggesting that APUM9-mediated mRNA decay predominantly occurs via the decapping-dependent exonucleolytic pathway.  APUM9 negatively regulates the expression of ABA signaling genes during seed imbibition, and thereby might contribute to the switch from dormant stage to seed germination. By contrast, strong TE-mediated repression of APUM9 is important for normal plant growth in the later developmental stages. Finally, APUM9 overexpression plants show slightly enhanced heat tolerance suggesting that TE-mediated epigenetic control of plant APUM9, might have a role not only in embryonic development, but also in plant adaptation to heat stress conditions.

The uptake of these metals is tightly regulated in plants. Some redox processes can alternatively use Fe-containing proteins or Cu-containing proteins, depending on nutritional status. Copper deficiency can rescue a Cucumis melo Fe uptake deficient mutant, and Fe deficiency can result in increased accumulation of Cu. However, the system responsible for Fe-deficiency-regulated Cu-uptake is unknown. To understand the genes and gene networks associated with Fe-deficiency regulated Cu uptake and Fe-Cu cross-talk, we conducted transcriptomic profiling of roots and rosettes of spl7 (a Cu uptake deficient mutant in arabidopsis) and Col-0 (WT) grown under Fe, Cu and simultaneous Fe and Cu deficiency conditions.

Transposable elements can promote hybridity through maternal small RNA, and have been postulated to regulate dosage response via neighboring imprinted genes. Here, we show that a highly conserved microRNA in plants, miR845, targets the tRNAMet primer-binding site (PBS) of LTR-retrotransposons in Arabidopsis pollen, and triggers the accumulation of 21 to 22-nucleotide small RNA in a dose dependent fashion via RNA polymerase IV. We show that these epigenetically activated small-interfering RNAs (easiRNAs) mediate hybridization barriers between diploid seed parents and tetraploid pollen parents  (“the triploid block”), and that natural variation for miR845 may account for “endosperm balance” allowing formation of triploid seeds. Targeting the PBS with small RNA is a common mechanism for transposon control in mammals and plants, and provides a uniquely sensitive means to monitor chromosome dosage and imprinting in the developing seed.

PRJNA415950	The COP9 Signalosome regulates seed germination by facilitating protein degradation of RGL2 and ABI5 (thale cress)	"The control of seed germination and seed dormancy are critical for the successful propagation of plant species, and are important agricultural traits. Seed germination is tightly controlled by the balance of gibberellin (GA) and abscisic acid (ABA), and is influenced by environmental factors. The COP9 Signalosome (CSN) is a conserved multi-subunit protein complex that is best known as a regulator of the Cullin-RING family of ubiquitin E3 ligases (CRLs). Multiple viable mutants of the CSN showed poor germination, except for csn5b-1. Detailed analyses showed that csn1-10 has a stronger seed dormancy, while csn5a-1 mutants exhibit retarded seed germination in addition to hyperdormancy. Both csn5a-1 and csn1-10 plants show defects in the timely removal of the germination inhibitors: RGL2, a repressor of GA signaling, and ABI5, an effector of ABA responses. We provide genetic evidence to demonstrate that the germination phenotype of csn1-10 is caused by over-accumulation of RGL2, a substrate of the SCF (CRL1) ubiquitin E3 ligase, while the csn5a-1 phenotype is caused by over-accumulation of RGL2 as well as ABI5. The genetic data are consistent with the hypothesis that CSN5A regulates ABI5 by a mechanism that may not involve CSN1. Transcriptome analyses suggest that CSN1 has a more prominent role than CSN5A during seed maturation, but CSN5A plays a more important role than CSN1 during seed germination, further supporting the functional distinction of these two CSN genes. Our study delineates the molecular targets of the CSN complex in seed germination, and reveals that CSN5 has additional functions in regulating ABI5, thus the ABA signaling pathway.
Overall design: Col-0, csn1-10, and csn5a-1 seeds were collected from plants grown side-by-side in the growth room. Seeds for Col-0 and csn1-10 were 1.5wks in storage, and csn5a-1 seeds were 4wk in storage. Approximately 100 microliter of settled seeds were used for RNA extraction for each sample. The 2-day imbibed seeds, prepared with the same volume of dry seeds as above, were sterilized, washed, and incubate on cell culture wells with 1ml of 0.5X liquid MS medium at 22oC under constant light for 2 days. Each sample points had three biological repeats. Seeds were centrifuged to remove the liquid, and were frozen in liquid nitrogen. The frozen seeds were ground to a fine powder using mortar and pestle in the presence of liquid nitrogen and small quantity of sterile quartz powder. RNA extraction was performed according to a published procedure [73].

PRJNA416658	Characterization of DCL4 missense alleles provides novel insights into its ability to process distinct classes of dsRNA substrates (thale cress)	"In the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, four Dicer-like proteins (DCL1-4) mediate the production of various classes of small RNAs (sRNAs). Among these four proteins, DCL4 is by far the most versatile RNaseIII-like enzyme and previously identified dcl4 missense alleles were shown to uncouple the production of the various classes of DCL4-dependent sRNAs. Yet, little is known about the molecular mechanism pertaining this uncoupled production. Here, by studying the subcellular localization, interactome and binding to the sRNA precursors of three distinct dcl4 missense alleles, we simultaneously highlight the absolute requirement of its helicase domain for efficient production of all DCL4-dependent sRNAs, and identify an important determinant of DCL4 versatility within its PAZ domain that is mandatory for efficient processing of intramolecular foldback dsRNA precursors but dispensable for the production of siRNAs from RDR-dependent dsRNA susbtrates. This study not only provides novel insights into DCL4 mode of action in plants but also delineates interesting tools to further study the complexity of plant RNA silencing pathways.

PRJNA418121	Global transcriptome of Arabidopsis thaliana and Solanum lycopersicum infected by S. sclerotiorum	"Plant pathogens with a broad host range are able to infect plant lineages that diverged over 100 million years ago. They exert similar and recurring constraints on the evolution of unrelated plant populations. Plants generally respond with quantitative disease resistance (QDR), a form of immunity relying on complex genetic determinants. In most cases, the molecular determinants of QDR and how they evolve is unknown. Here we identify in Arabidopsis thaliana a gene mediating QDR against Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, agent of the white mold disease, and provide evidence of its convergent evolution in multiple plant species. Using genome wide association mapping in A. thaliana, we associated the gene encoding the POQR prolyl-oligopeptidase with QDR against S. sclerotiorum. Loss of this gene compromised QDR against S. sclerotiorum but not against a bacterial pathogen. Natural diversity analysis associated POQR sequence with QDR. Remarkably, the same amino acid changes occurred after independent duplications of POQR in ancestors of multiple plant species, including A. thaliana and tomato. Genome-scale expression analyses revealed that parallel divergence in gene expression upon S. sclerotiorum infection is a frequent pattern in genes, such as POQR, that duplicated both in A. thaliana and tomato. Our study identifies a previously uncharacterized gene mediating QDR against S. sclerotiorum. It shows that some QDR determinants are conserved in distantly related plants and have emerged through the repeated use of similar genetic polymorphisms at different evolutionary time scales.

To further investigate the downstream targets of REF6 represented H3K27me3 demethylase, we performed RNA-seq using single, double mutant and triple mutant. Using chromatin-immunoprecipitation followed by high-throughput sequencing, we mapped thousands of binding targets of REF6 in flowers and in addition, we used a second fixative, DSG to capture more indirect targets of REF6. In order to investigate the function of indirect binding of REF6 represented H3K27me3 demethylase, the binding targets of DNA binding domain deleted REF6 were identified in the triple mutant background in which REF6 and its two homologs were mutated. Meanwhile, the H3K27me3 marked regions in both wild type and triple mutant flowers were defined. By analyzing the differentially enriched H3K27me3 region and REF6 binding profile, we found that REF6 functions to determine the boundary of H3K27me3 regions. Comparison of binding profiles of REF6 in flowers and in seedlings (ref) revealed a tissue-specific binding manner. More importantly, we found that the indirect binding of REF6 is mediated by trans factors and this indirect binding is crucial for REF6 function, especially in reproductive organs in Arabidopsis.

The majority of endosperm genes are expressed in a 2:1 maternal:paternal ratio, reflecting genomic DNA content. Here we find that the 2:1 transcriptional ratio is, unexpectedly, actively regulated. In A. thaliana and A. lyrata, endosperm 24 nt small RNAs are reduced in TEs and enriched in genes compared to the embryo. We find an inverse relationship between the parent-of-origin of sRNAs and mRNAs, with genes more likely to be associated with maternally than paternally biased sRNAs. Disruption of the Pol IV sRNA pathway causes a shift toward maternal allele mRNA expression for many genes. Furthermore, paternal inheritance of an RNA Pol IV mutation is sufficient to rescue seed abortion caused by excess paternal genome dosage. Thus, RNA Pol IV mediates transcriptional balance between maternally and paternally inherited genomes in endosperm.

PRJNA418787	Direct role of MUTE in cell state switch and symmetric cell division to create stomata (thale cress)	"Precise cell division control is critical for developmental patterning. For the differentiation of a functional stoma, a cellular valve for efficient gas exchange, the single symmetric division of an immediate precursor is absolutely essential. Yet, the mechanism governing the single division event remains unclear. Here we report the complete inventories of gene expression by the Arabidopsis bHLH protein MUTE, a potent inducer of stomatal differentiation. We found that MUTE switches the gene expression program initiated by its sister bHLH, SPEECHLESS and directly induces a suite of cell-cycle genes and their transcriptional repressors. The architecture of the regulatory network initiated by MUTE represents an Incoherent Type 1 Feed-Forward Loop. Our study delineates the role for MUTE in orchestrating a transcriptional cascade leading to stomatal differentiation, and unravels a core regulatory circuit.

PRJNA419306	Transcriptome dynamics at Arabidopsis graft junctions reveal an intertissue recognition mechanism that activates vascular regeneration (thale cress)	"The ability for cut tissues to join together and form a chimeric organism is a remarkable property of many plants, however, grafting is poorly characterized at the molecular level. To better understand this process we monitored genome-wide temporal and spatial gene expression changes in grafted Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyls. Tissues above and below the graft rapidly developed an asymmetry such that many genes were more highly expressed on one side than the other. This asymmetry correlated with sugar responsive genes and we observed an accumulation of starch above the graft that decreased along with asymmetry once the sugar-transporting vascular tissues reconnected. Despite the initial starvation response below the graft, many genes associated with vascular formation were rapidly activated in grafted tissues but not in cut and separated tissues indicating that a recognition mechanism activated that was independent of functional vascular connections. Auxin which is transported cell-to-cell, had a rapidly elevated response that was symmetric, suggesting that auxin was perceived by the root within hours of tissue attachment to activate the vascular regeneration process. A subset of genes were expressed only in grafted tissues, indicating that wound healing proceeded via different mechanisms depending on the presence or absence of adjoining tissues. Such a recognition process could have broader relevance for tissue regeneration, inter-tissue communication and tissue fusion events.
Overall design: We analyzed the poly-adenylated transcriptomes of Arabidopsis thaliana hypocotyle tissue during grafting.

PRJNA419486	INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION 1 is a male fertility regulator impacting anther dehydration in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Our results show that ICE1 controls plant male fertility via impacting anther dehydration. The loss-of-function mutation in ICE1 gene in Arabidopsis caused anther indehiscence and decreased pollen viability as well as germination rate. Further analysis revealed that the anthers in the mutant of ICE1 (ice1-2) had the structure of stomium, though the epidermis did not shrink to dehisce. The anther indehiscence and influenced pollen viability as well as germination in ice1-2 were due to abnormal anther dehydration, for most of anthers dehisced with drought treatment and pollen grains from those dehydrated anthers had similar viability and germination rates compared with wild type. Accordingly, the sterility of ice1-2 could be rescued by ambient dehydration treatments. Likewise, the stomatal differentiation of ice1-2 anther epidermis was disrupted in a different manner compared with that in leaves. ICE1 specifically bound to MYC-recognition elements in the promoter of FAMA, a key regulator of guard cell differentiation, to activate FAMA expression. Transcriptome profiling in the anther tissues further exhibited ICE1-modulated genes associated with water transport and ion exchange in the anther. Together, this work reveals the key role of ICE1 in male fertility control and establishes a regulatory network mediated by ICE1 for stomata development and water movement in the anther.

PRJNA421154	Ethylene promotes root hair growth through coordinated EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 activity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Root hairs are an extensive structure of root epidermal cells and are critical for nutrient acquisition, soil anchorage, and environ- mental interactions in sessile plants. The phytohormone ethylene (ET) promotes root hair growth and also mediates the effects of different signals that stimulate hair cell development. However, the molecular basis of ET-induced root hair growth remains poorly understood. Here, we show that ET-activated transcription factor ETHYLENE-INSENSITIVE 3 (EIN3) physically interacts with ROOT HAIR DEFECTIVE 6 (RHD6), a well-documented positive regulator of hair cells, and that the two factors directly coactivate the hair length-determining gene RHD6-LIKE 4 (RSL4) to promote root hair elongation. Transcriptome analysis further revealed the parallel roles of the regulator pairs EIN3/EIL1 (EIN3-LIKE 1) and RHD6/ RSL1 (RHD6-LIKE 1). EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 coordinately en- hance root hair initiation by selectively regulating a subset of core root hair (H) genes. Thus, our work reveals a key transcriptional complex consisting of EIN3/EIL1 and RHD6/RSL1 in the control of root hair initiation and elongation, and provides a molecular framework for the integration of environmental signals and in- trinsic regulators in modulating plant organ development.
Overall design: Col-0, ein3 eil1, rhd6 rsl1 and ein3 eil1 rhd6 rsl1 were grown vertically on MS medium for 6 d and then treated with or without ET at 10 ppm for 4 h.

PRJNA421355	RNA-Seq Analysis of Genes Differentially Expressed across temporal and spatial deposition of wall ingrowths in Arabidopsis Phloem Parenchyma Transfer Cells (thale cress)	"Transfer cells (TCs) play important roles in facilitating enhanced rates of nutrient transport at key apoplasmic/symplasmic junctions along the nutrient acquisition and transport pathways in plants. TCs achieve this capacity by developing elaborate wall ingrowth networks which serve to increase plasma membrane surface area thus increasing the cell’s surface area-to-volume ratio to achieve increased flux of nutrients across the plasma membrane. Phloem parenchyma (PP) cells of Arabidopsis leaf veins trans-differentiate to become PP TCs which likely function in a two-step phloem loading mechanism by facilitating unloading of photoassimilates into the apoplasm for subsequent energy-dependent uptake into the sieve element/companion cell (SE/CC) complex. We are using PP TCs in Arabidopsis as a genetic model to identify transcription factors involved in coordinating deposition of the wall ingrowth network. Confocal imaging of pseudo-Schiff propidium iodide-stained tissue revealed different profiles of temporal development of wall ingrowth deposition across maturing cotyledons and juvenile leaves, and a basipetal gradient of deposition across mature adult leaves. RNA-Seq analysis was undertaken to identify differentially expressed genes common to these three different profiles of wall ingrowth deposition. This analysis identified 68 transcription factors up-regulated two-fold or more in at least two of the three experimental comparisons, with six of these transcription factors belonging to Clade III of the NAC-domain family. Phenotypic analysis of these NAC genes using insertional mutants revealed significant reductions in levels of wall ingrowth deposition, particularly in a double mutant of NAC056 and NAC018, as well as compromised sucrose-dependent root growth, indicating impaired capacity for phloem loading. Collectively, these results support the proposition that Clade III members of the NAC domain family in Arabidopsis play important roles in regulating wall ingrowth deposition in PP TCs.
Overall design: The sampling enabled three different temporal and spatial pair-wise comparisons for RNA-Seq analysis, namely: (i) cotyledons at Day 5 vs Day 10; (ii) Leaf 1 and Leaf 2 (first juvenile leaves) at Day 10 vs Day 16; and (iii) basal vs apical third (base vs tip) of Leaf 12 at Day 31.

PRJNA421832	Functional analysis of HD2C in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Ribosome biogenesis is a fundamental process required for all cellular activities. Histone deacetylases play critical roles in many biological processes including transcriptional repression and rDNA silencing. However, their function in pre-rRNA processing remains poorly understood. Here, we discovered a previously uncharacterized role of Arabidopsis histone deacetylase HD2C in pre-rRNA processing via both canonical and non-canonical manners. HD2C interacts with HD2B and forms homo- and/or hetero-oligomers in the nucleolus. Depletion of HD2C and HD2B induces a ribosome biogenesis deficiency morphological phenotype and aberrant accumulation of 18S pre-rRNA intermediates. Our genome-wide analysis revealed that HD2C binds and represses the expression of key genes involved in ribosome biogenesis. Using RNA immunoprecipitation and sequencing, we further uncovered a non-canonical mechanism of HD2C directly associating with pre-rRNA and small nucleolar RNAs to regulate rRNA methylation. Together, this study reveals a multifaceted role of HD2C in ribosome biogenesis and provides mechanistic insights into how histone deacetylases modulate rRNA maturation at both transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels.

PRJNA422426	RNA-directed DNA methylation involves co-transcriptional small RNA-guided slicing of Pol V transcripts in Arabidopsis. (thale cress)	"Small RNAs regulate chromatin modifications such as DNA methylation and gene silencing across eukaryotic genomes. In plants, RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) requires 24-nucleotide (nt) small RNAs (siRNAs) that bind ARGONAUTE4 (AGO4) and target genomic regions for silencing. It also requires non-coding RNAs transcribed by RNA POLYMERASE V (Pol V), that likely serve as scaffolds for binding of AGO4/siRNA complexes. Here we utilized a modified global nuclear run-on (GRO) protocol followed by deep sequencing to capture Pol V nascent transcripts genome-wide.  We uncovered unique characteristics of Pol V RNAs, including a uracil (U) common at position 10.  This uracil was complementary to the 5’ adenine found in many AGO4-bound 24-nt siRNAs and was eliminated in an siRNA-deficient mutant as well as in the ago4/6/9 triple mutant, suggesting that the +10U signature is due to siRNA-mediated co-transcriptional slicing of Pol V transcripts. Expressing wild-type AGO4 in ago4/6/9 was able to restore slicing of Pol V transcripts but a catalytically inactive AGO4 mutant did not correct the slicing defect. We also found that Pol V transcript slicing required the little understood elongation factor SPT5L.  These results highlight the importance of Pol V transcript slicing in RNA-mediated transcriptional gene silencing, which is a conserved process in many eukaryotes.

PRJNA422618	B-box family proteins BBX18 and BBX23 control thermoresponsive hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Plants coordinate their growth and developmental programs with various endogenous signals and environmental challenges such as seasonal and diurnal temperature fluctuations. The bHLH transcription factor PIF4 plays critical roles in thermoresponsive hypocotyl growth in Arabidopsis, and the evening complex component ELF3 negatively regulates PIF4's activity for downstream gene expression and hypocotyl elongation at elevated temperature. However, how warm temperature signal is transmitted to ELF3 is not known. Here, we report the identification of two B-Box protein BBX18/BBX23 as new regulators of thermomorphogenesis in Arabidopsis. Mutations of BBX18/BBX23 confer reduced thermoresponsive hypocotyl elongation. Overexpression of BBX18 enhances the sensitivity of hypocotyl growth to elevated temperature, which is dependent on the function of PIF4 and RING E3 ligase COP1, respectively. Both BBX18 and BBX23 interact with ELF3 or COP1, relegating the protein abundance of ELF3 at warm temperature. Further, the expression of multiple thermoresponsive genes is impaired in both the PIF4 single mutant and BBX18/BBX23 double mutant. In addition, both the transcription and protein levels of BBX18/BBX23 are up-regulated by elevated ambient temperature. Thus, our findings reveal the important roles of B-Box proteins in plant thermomorphogenesis, and build a new connection from warm temperature information to ELF3 and its downstream signaling components.

PRJNA427134	The Complex Architecture of Transgene Insertions (thale cress)	"Over the last 30 years the soil bacterium Agrobacterium tumefaciens has been the workhorse tool for plant genome engineering. Replacement of native tumor-inducing (Ti) plasmid elements with customizable cassettes enabled insertion of a sequence of interest as “Transfer DNA” (T-DNA) into the plant genome of interest. Although these T-DNA transfer mechanisms are well understood, detailed understanding of the structure and epigenomic status of insertion events was limited by current technologies. To fill this gap, we analyzed transgenic Arabidopsis thaliana lines from three widely used collections (SALK, SAIL and WISC) with two single molecule technologies, optical genome mapping and nanopore sequencing. Optical maps for four randomly selected T-DNA lines revealed between one and seven insertions/rearrangements with unexpectedly large sizes ranging from 27 to 236 kilobases. De novo nanopore-based genome assemblies for two heterozygous lines resolved T-DNA structures up to 36 kb and revealed large-scale T-DNA associated translocations and exchange of chromosome arm ends. The multiple internally rearranged nature of T-DNA arrays, consisting of identical T-DNA/backbone concatemers made full assembly even for long nanopore reads impossible. For the current TAIR10 reference genome, nanopore contigs corrected 83% of non-centromeric misassemblies. This unprecedented nucleotide-level definition of T-DNA insertions enabled the mapping of epigenome data. The SALK_059379 T-DNA insertions were enriched for 24nt siRNAs and contained dense cytosine DNA methylation. Transgene silencing via the RNA directed DNA methylation pathway was confirmed by in planta assays. In contrast, SAIL_232 T-DNA sequence was predominantly targeted by 21/22nt siRNAs, and DNA methylation and silencing was limited to the GUS gene, but not the resistance gene. With the emergence of genome editing technologies that rely on Agrobacterium for gene delivery, this study provides new insights into the structural impact of engineering plant genomes and demonstrates the utility of state-of-the-art long-range sequencing technologies to rapidly identify unanticipated genomic changes.

PRJNA427312	The histone variant H2A.Z and chromatin remodeler BRAHMA act coordinately and antagonistically to regulate transcription and nucleosome dynamics in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Plants adapt to changes in their environment by regulating transcription and chromatin organization. The histone H2A variant H2A.Z and the SWI2/SNF2 ATPase BRAHMA have overlapping roles in positively and negatively regulating environmentally responsive genes in Arabidopsis, but the extent of this overlap was uncharacterized. Both have been associated with various changes in nucleosome positioning and stability in different contexts, but their specific roles in transcriptional regulation and chromatin organization need further characterization. We show that H2A.Z and BRM act both cooperatively and antagonistically to contribute directly to transcriptional repression and activation of genes involved in development and response to environmental stimuli. We identified 8 classes of genes that show distinct relationships between H2A.Z and BRM and their roles in transcription. We found that H2A.Z contributes to a range of different nucleosome properties, while BRM stabilizes nucleosomes where it binds and destabilizes and/or repositions flanking nucleosomes. H2A.Z and BRM contribute to +1 nucleosome destabilization, especially where they coordinately regulate transcription. While profiling nucleosomes in arp6 mutants, we discovered that large deletions had accumulated in the arp6 genome. We also found that at genes regulated by both BRM and H2A.Z, both factors overlap with the binding sites of light-regulated transcription factors PIF4, PIF5, and FRS9, and that some of the FRS9 binding sites are dependent on H2A.Z and BRM for accessibility. Collectively, we comprehensively characterized the antagonistic and cooperative contributions of H2A.Z and BRM to transcriptional regulation, and illuminated their interrelated roles in chromatin organization. The variability observed in their individual functions implies that both BRM and H2A.Z have more context-specific roles within diverse chromatin environments than previously assumed.
Overall design: We performed MNase-seq, H2A.Z ChIP-seq, and RNA-seq on 4-5 leaf developmentally-staged, shoot Arabidopsis material from WT, arp6-1, and brm-1.

The goal of this study is to elucidate signaling events following RGF1 action.
Methods: mRNA profiles of the root meristematic zone from Arabidopsis seedlings with or without RGF1 treatment were generated by deep sequencing, in triplicate. The sequence reads were analyzed using Tophat and DESeq2. The mutants of selected differentially expressed genes were generated for phenotyping.
Results: Our study uncovered a series of signaling events following RGF1 action. The RGF1-receptor pathway controls distribution of reactive oxygen species (ROS) along the developmental zones of the Arabidopsis root. We identify a novel transcription factor, RGF1 INDUCIBLE TRANSCRIPTION FACTOR 1 (RITF1), which plays a central role in mediating RGF1 signaling. Manipulating RITF1 expression leads to redistribution of ROS along the root developmental zones. Changes in ROS distribution, in turn, enhance the stability of the PLETHORA2 (PLT2) protein, a master regulator of root stem cells.
Conclusions: Our study clearly depicts a signaling cascade initiated by RGF1 and links the RGF1 peptide to ROS regulatory mechanisms.

PRJNA429044	The calmodulin-like protein, CML39, is involved in regulating seed development, germination, and fruit development in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"In addition to the evolutionarily-conserved Ca2+ sensor, calmodulin (CaM), plants possess a large family of CaM-related proteins (CMLs). Using a cml39 loss-of-function mutant, we investigated the roles of CML39 in Arabidopsis and discovered a range of phenotypes across developmental stages and in different tissues.  In mature plants, loss of CML39 results in shorter siliques, reduced seed number per silique, and reduced number of ovules per pistil. We also observed changes in seed development, germination, and seed coat properties in cml39 mutants in comparison to wild-type plants. Using radicle emergence as a measure of germination, cml39 mutants showed more rapid germination than wild-type plants. In marked contrast to wild-type seeds, the germination of developing, immature cml39 seeds was not sensitive to cold-stratification. In addition, germination of cml39 seeds was less sensitive than wild-type to inhibition by ABA or by treatments that impaired gibberellic acid biosynthesis. Tetrazolium red staining indicated that the seed-coat permeability of cml39 seeds is greater than that of wild-type seeds. RNA sequencing analysis of cml39 seedlings suggests that changes in chromatin modification may underlie some of the phenotypes associated with cml39 mutants, consistent with previous reports that orthologs of CML39 participate in gene silencing.  Aberrant ectopic expression of transcripts for seed storage proteins in 7-day old cml39 seedlings was observed, suggesting mis-regulation of early developmental programs.  Collectively, our data support a model where CML39 serves as an important Ca2+ sensor during ovule and seed development, as well as during germination and seedling establishment.
Overall design: Global gene expression profiles were compared between cml39 mutant and wild-type control seedlings (in duplicate). Less..."

PRJNA429126	Ethylene-independent Promotion of Photomorphogenesis by Cytokinin Requires a Functional Cytokinin and Light Signaling Pathway. (thale cress)	"The transition of skotomorphogenesis to photomorphogenesis is induced by the perception of light and is characterized by the inhibition of hypocotyl elongation and opening of cotyledons. Although it is known that the plant hormone cytokinin, when applied in high concentrations, inhibits hypocotyl elongation in the dark-grown Arabidopsis plants, it is unclear to what extent this response is the result of cytokinin alone or cytokinin-induced ethylene production. We show that treatment of etiolated seedlings in presence of ethylene inhibitors (eg. AgNO3) or treatment of the ethylene-resistant mutant ein2, resulted in a significant inhibition of hypocotyl elongation. This indicates that cytokinin induced de-etiolation is largely independent of ethylene and suggests a close connection between the cytokinin two component system and the light singalling networks. We show that this cytokinin signal is mainly mediated through the cytokinin receptor ARIBIDOPSIS HISTIDIN KINASE 3 (AHK3) and the ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATORS 1 (ARR1) in combination with ARR12. Interestingly, mutation of COP1, DET1 and CIN4/COP10 renders plants insensitive to cytokinin and these factors are indispensable for the transcriptional response during cytokinin induced de-etiolation which indicates that a functional light signaling pathway is essential for this cytokinin response. In addition, the cytokinin effect on hypocotyl elongation is highly dependent on the ambient light conditions where higher light intensities causes a switch in the response to CK from an inhibitor to a promoter of hypocotyl elongation.

We found that the repair of cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers for a large fraction of the genome is controlled by the joint actions of the circadian clock and transcription by RNA polymerase II. Arabidopsis has a relatively compact genome, and a large fraction of the genes are controlled by the circadian clock. Our data on the interface of these two global regulatory systems reveal very strong repair preference of the transcribed strands of Arabidopsis genes, 10 to 30% of which are circadian time-dependent. Thus, throughout the day, Arabidopsis exhibits enormous dynamic range in repair to cope with exposure to sunlight.

PRJNA429347	Transcriptome analysis of isoxaben-induced loss of cell wall integrity in Arabidopsis seedling liquid culture (thale cress)	"Plant cells are surrounded by walls, which must often meet opposing functional requirements during plant growth and defense. The cells meet them by modifying wall structure and composition in a tightly controlled and adaptive manner. The modifications seem to be mediated by a dedicated cell wall integrity (CWI) maintenance mechanism. Currently the mode of action of the mechanism is not understood and it is unclear how its activity is coordinated with established plant defense signaling. We investigated both the responses to cell wall damage (CWD) compromising CWI and the underlying mechanism in Arabidopsis thaliana. A cellulose biosynthesis inhibitor isoxaben was used as a tool to induce the loss of cell wall integrity. Isoxaben was chosen because it only affects a certain cell type / differentiation stage, and weakens the cell walls indirectly by inhibiting a biosynthetic process, making CWD occurrence dependent on high turgor levels (allowing simultaneous manipulation of the responses by addition of osmotica like sorbitol, mannitol, etc.). Isoxaben treatment causes structural damage, induction of lesion formation, cell death, deposition of lignin and callose as well as production of jasmonic acid and salicylic acid. Isoxaben-resistant mutant ixr1-1 is included to ensure the specificity of the treatment.

PRJNA429659	Targeted DNA demethylation of the Arabidopsis genome using the Human TET1 catalytic domain. (thale cress)	"DNA methylation is important for silencing genes and transposable elements. Changes in DNA methylation can be heritable and thus, the loss or gain of methylation can lead to the formation of stable epialleles. A well characterized example of a stable epiallele in plants is fwa-4, which consists of the loss of DNA cytosine methylation (5mC) in the promoter of the FLOWERING WAGENINGEN (FWA) gene, causing upregulation of FWA and a heritable late flowering phenotype. Here we demonstrate that a fusion between the catalytic domain of the Human demethylase TEN-ELEVEN TRANSLOCATION1 (TET1cd) and an artificial zinc finger (ZF) designed to target the FWA promoter can cause highly efficient targeted demethylation, FWA upregulation, and a heritable late flowering phenotype. Additional ZF-TET1cd fusions designed to target methylated regions of the CACTA1 transposon also caused targeted demethylation and changes in expression. Finally, we have developed a CRISPR/dCAS9 based targeted demethylation system using the TET1cd and a modified SunTag system and demonstrate its ability to target demethylation at and activate the expression of FWA and CACTA1. Our study provides tools for targeted removal of 5mC at specific loci in the genome with high specificity and minimal off-target effects. These tools provide the opportunity to develop new epialleles for traits of interest, and to reactivate expression of previously silenced genes, transgenes, or transposons.

For the WRKY transcription factors, which are important regulators not only of this defense response, it appears that they act in a complex regulatory sub-network rather than in a linear fashion, which is much more vulnerable to gene function loss either by pathogen-derived effectors or by mutations. In this study we employed RNA-seq, mass spectrometry and ChIP-seq to find evidence for and uncover principles and characteristics of this network.

PRJNA431443	Cellulose perturbation has broad impacts on resource allocation in Arabidopsis thaliana putatively mediated by glycine rich peptides (thale cress)	"The interplay between plant chemistry and architecture was investigated using a pharmacological approach combined with mutant analysis. Due to the high abundance and essential role of cellulose in plant development and function, it was hypothesized that perturbation of cellulose biosynthesis would have far-reaching effects on plant chemistry and resource allocation. The impact of cellulose disruption was studied through comprehensive multiphase-NMR (CMP-NMR) using the Arabidopsis thaliana cellulose synthase mutant ectopic lignification1 (eli1). CMP-NMR confirmed several known metabolic impacts of cellulose disruption including increased lignification, increased starch production, and a shift from crystalline to amorphous cellulose. It also revealed unexpected metabolic impacts such as increased methanol production, increased seed-derived lipid content, and the presence of the peptide pentaglycine, which had not been previously observed in plants. It was further hypothesized that the metabolic impacts of cellulose disruption are mediated by one or more signal molecules that would be elevated in cellulose synthase mutants such as eli1. The presence of one or more signal molecules in eli1 that induce a lignification response was confirmed by exposing wild-type seedlings to ground tissue from eli1. Treatment of wild-type seedlings with pentaglycine suggested that the peptide may be at least partially responsible for mediating this response. A case is made for glycine rich proteins (GRPs) as the source of pentaglycine in vivo, and for wall associated kinases (WAKs) as receptors that trigger either developmental or defence responses through differential binding of intact GRPs and oligoglycine peptides.

PRJNA431621	DNA replication origins in whole Arabidopsis seedlings (thale cress)	"Full genome replication in eukaryotes depends on the function of thousands of DNA replication origins (ORIs). The genome-wide identification of ORI location, achieved for animal and plant cells in culture, has been important to define their DNA and chromatin features. A major challenge in the field is to approach the biology of ORIs in whole organisms to understand their developmental plasticity. Here, we have determined the ORI location, activity and chromatin landscape in two developmental stages of Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that ORIs associate with multiple chromatin signatures including the most frequent at TSS but also at proximal and distal gene regulatory regions or repressed Polycomb domains. In constitutive heterochromatin, a high fraction of ORIs colocalize with GC-rich retrotransposons. Quantitative analysis of ORI activity led us to conclude that strong ORIs possess high scores of local GC content and clusters of GGN trinucleotides that may form G quadruplexes and other G-rich structures. We also found that development primarily influences ORI firing strength rather than the location of ORIs in different genomic loci. Moreover, ORIs that preferentially fire at early vegetative stages colocalize with GC-rich heterochromatin whereas those at later stages associate with transcribed genes. Our results provide the first identification of ORI features in a whole organism, opening new ways of studying DNA replication in different cell types in the context of development under normal and mutant conditions.
Overall design: We isolated replication intermediates to purify short nascent strands of increasing size (Fractions 3, 4 and 5+6+7) from two developmental stages of Arabidopsis seedlings (4 and 10 day-old).

Here, we adapted mammalian Native Elongation Transcript sequencing and Global Run On sequencing to profile nascent RNA genome wide in Arabidopsis. We found Pol II tends to accumulate downstream of transcription start site and pausing at proximal promoter is an important regulatory step for Pol II transcription although loosely controlled. Furthermore, the Pol II with unphosphorylated carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) mainly accumulates downstream the TSS, while the Ser5P CTD Pol II associates with spliceosome, and the Ser2P CTD Pol II presents a sharp peak 250 base pair downstream of polyadenylation site indicating a stringent control of termination for protein coding genes; whilst the termination of noncoding genes is not. Active expressed genes can be classified into three clusters according to the distribution patterns of different Pol II isoforms. In summary, we demonstrated the modified plant GRO-seq and mNET-seq are suitable to study RNA Pol II dynamics in planta. Although transcription is conserved among high eukaryotes, Pol II has its feature in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA359478	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)TET-mediated epimutagenesis of the Arabidopsis thaliana methylome	"DNA methylation in the promoters of plant genes sometimes leads to transcriptional repression, and the wholesale removal of DNA methylation as seen in methyltransferase mutants results in drastic changes in gene expression and severe developmental defects. However, many cases of naturally-occurring DNA methylation variations have been reported, whereby the altered expression of differentially methylated genes is responsible for agronomically important traits. The ability to manipulate plant methylomes to generate populations of epigenetically distinct individuals could provide invaluable resources for breeding and research purposes. Here we describe “epimutagenesis”, a novel method to rapidly generate variation of DNA methylation through random demethylation of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome. This method involves the expression of a human Ten-eleven translocation (TET) enzyme, and results in widespread hypomethylation that can be inherited to subsequent generations, mimicking mutants in the maintenance DNA methyltransferase met1. Application of TET-mediated epimutagenesis to agriculturally significant plants may result in differential expression of alleles normally silenced by DNA methylation, uncovering previously hidden phenotypic variations.

PRJNA433180	A Lignin Molecular Brace Controls Precision Processing of Cell Wall Critical for Surface Integrity in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"The cell wall is a defining feature of plant cells and glues cells to each other. To overcome this physical constraint, plants must process and disconnect cell wall linkages during growth and development. However, little is known about the mechanism guiding cell-cell detachment and cell wall remodeling.  Here, we identify two neighboring cell types in Arabidopsis that coordinate their activities to control cell wall processing, thereby ensuring precise abscission to discard organs.  One cell type produces a honeycomb structure of lignin, which acts as a mechanical ‘brace’ to localize cell wall breakdown and spatially limit abscising cells.  The second cell type undergoes transdifferentiation into epidermal cells, forming protective cuticle, demonstrating de novo specification of epidermal cells, previously thought to be restricted to embryogenesis. Loss of the lignin brace leads to inadequate cuticle formation, resulting in surface barrier defects and susceptible to infection.  Altogether, we show how plants precisely accomplish abscission.

PRJNA433404	Direct control of SPEECHLESS by PIF4 in the high temperature response of stomatal development (thale cress)	"Environmental factors shape the phenotypes of multicellular organisms. The production of stomata—the epidermal pores required for gas exchange in plants—is highly plastic, and provides a powerful platform to address environmental influence on cell differentiation [1-3]. Rising temperatures are already impacting plant growth, a trend expected to worsen in the near future [4]. High temperature inhibits stomatal production but the underlying mechanism is not known [5]. Here, we show that elevated temperature suppresses the expression of SPEECHLESS (SPCH), the bHLH transcription factor that serves as the master regulator of stomatal lineage initiation [6,7]. Our genetic and expression analyses indicate that the suppression of SPCH and stomatal production is mediated by the bHLH transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4), a core component of high temperature signaling [8]. Importantly, we demonstrate that upon exposure to high temperature, PIF4 accumulates in the stomatal precursors and binds to the promoter of SPCH. In addition, we find SPCH feeds back negatively to the PIF4 gene. We propose a model where the high temperature-activated PIF4 binds and represses SPCH expression to restrict stomatal production at high temperature. Our work identifies a molecular link connecting high temperature signaling and stomatal development, and reveals a direct mechanism by which production of a specific cell lineage can be controlled by a broadly-expressed environmental signaling factor.

PRJNA342475	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Stress-responsive pathways and small RNA changes distinguish variable developmental phenotypes caused by MSH1 loss	Loss of MSH1 causes an array of phenotypes, including variegation, dwarfism, altered leaf morphology, delayed flowering, and male sterility. Mutant individuals showing strong phenotypes are often more tolerant to abiotic stress, such as drought or high light. Interestingly, newly derived pedigrees from T-DNA mutants have little phenotype in the S1 homozygous generation, but show the full range of phenotypes starting in the S2 homozygous generation. We performed RNA-seq and sRNA-seq to characterize the differences between msh1 S1 and S2 generation plants, and between individuals of different phenotypes. We find that the degree of transcriptome changes increases according to phenotypic severity, and that the underlying affected pathways include interconnected processes such as abiotic and biotic stress response, plastid regulation, phytohormones, circadian rhythm, and ROS. Small RNA changes also increase from S1 to S2 generations, with different trends depending on phenotype. Together, these results demonstrate the importance of MSH1 function and the downstream pathways that it affects, and help explain the observed stress tolerance associated with particular MSH1 phenotypes.

PRJDB5680	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-Seq of Arabidopsis seeds before and after priming treatments	Seed priming is a commercially used technique for improving seed performance including germination. However, the treatment sometimes reduces seed longevity as a side effect, limiting the storable period of the seeds. The goal of this study is to understand the gene expressions involved in the loss of seed longevity during priming. Est-1 is an accession of Arabidopsis thaliana that retained relatively longer longevity after priming compared with a standard laboratory accession Col-0. Among 279 recombinant inbred lines (RILs) derived from a cross between Col-0 and Est-1, 25 RILs that showed relatively longer longevity were bulked as bulked-long RILs (BL) and 25 RILs that showed relatively shorter longevity were bulked as bulked-short RILs (BS). We performed RNA-Seq of these seeds before and after priming treatments (CN: non-primed Col-0, EN: non-primed Est-1, CP: primed Col-0, EP: primed Est-1, BL: primed bulked-long, and BS: primed bulked-short).

PRJEB20122	EOL1 recruits LHP1-PRC2 during DNA-replicationA Ctf4 related protein recruits LHP1-PRC2 to maintain H3K27me3 levels in dividing cells in Arabidopsis thaliana	Polycomb Repressive Complex (PRC) 2 catalyzes the H3K27me3 modification that warrants inheritance of a repressive chromatin structure during mitosis thereby assuring stable target gene repression in differentiated cells. It is still under investigation how H3K27me3 is passed on from maternal to filial strands during DNA replication; however, cell division can reinforce H3K27me3 coverage at target regions. To identify novel factors involved in the Polycomb pathway in plants, we performed a forward genetic screen for enhancers of the like heterochromatin protein 1 (lhp1) mutant, which shows relatively mild phenotypic alterations compared to other plant PRC mutants. We mapped enhancer of lhp1 (eol) 1 to a gene related to yeast Chromosome transmission fidelity 4 (Ctf4) based on phylogenetic analysis, structural similarities, physical interaction with the CMG helicase component SLD5 and an expression pattern confined to actively dividing cells. A combination of eol1 with the curly leaf (clf) allele, carrying a mutation in the catalytic core of PRC2, strongly enhanced the clf phenotype; furthermore, H3K27me3 coverage at target genes was strongly reduced in eol1 clf double mutants compared to clf single mutants. EOL1 physically interacted with CLF, its partially redundant paralog SWINGER (SWN) and LHP1. We propose that EOL1 interacts with LHP1-PRC2 complexes during replication and thereby participates in maintaining the H3K27me3 mark at target genes. Less...

PRJEB18487	Strobilurins as growth-promoting compounds: How Stroby regulates Arabidopsis leaf growth	Strobilurins are an important class of agrochemical fungicides used throughout the world on a wide variety of crops to protect against fungal pathogens. In addition to their protective role against pathogens, they are reported to also positively influence plant physiology. In this study, we analyzed the effect of Stroby® WG, a commercially available fungicide consisting of 50% (w/w) kresoxim-methyl (KM) as active strobilurin compound, on Arabidopsis plant growth. Treatment of seeds or seedlings with Stroby resulted in larger leaves due to an increase in cell number. Transcriptome analysis of Stroby-treated rosettes demonstrated an increased expression of genes involved in redox homeostasis, iron metabolism and sugar transport. Stroby treatment strongly induced the expression of the subgroup Ib basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factors, which have a role in iron homeostasis under iron-limiting conditions. Less...

PRJEB15204	AtPRMT5 regulates shoot regeneration through modulating multiple genes expression analyzed by RNA-seq	Protein arginine methylation plays essential roles in diverse biological processes, but its role in regulating shoot regeneration remains elusive. In this study, we analyzed the function of the protein arginine methyltransferase AtPRMT5 during de novo shoot regeneration in Arabidopsis. AtPRMT5 encodes a type II PRMT that methylates proteins, including histones and RNA splicing factors. Mutation of AtPMRT5 decreased the frequency of shoot regeneration and number of shoots per callus in the atprmt5 mutant compared with those of the wild type. To understand the mechanism of AtPRMT5 regulation of shoot regeneration, we analyzed the transcript levels of wild type and the mutant atprmt5 calli during shoot regeneration by RNA-seq. Three biological repeats of wild type and the mutant atprmt5-1 calli were used for RNA sequencing. Total RNAs were isolated from the calli of wild type Col and the mutant atprmt5-1 cultured on cultured on shoot-induction medium. The RNA-seq llibraries were constructed with TruSeq Stranded mRNA Library Prep Kit and sequenced using the Illumina Hiseq 2500. The raw reads were aligned to the genome sequences of TAIR10 using Tophat software. The gene expression levels were measured in RPKM, and many critical genes regulated by AtPRMT5 were identified to be involved in shoot regeneration. Less...

PRJEB15457	Gene expression between dry and imbibed seeds in vitamin C defective (vtc) mutants and wild-type Arabidopsis thaliana	In the dry state, orthodox seeds have little antioxidant capacity, relying on reduced glutathione and tocochromanols for antioxidant defences rather than ascorbate or ascorbate peroxidase (APX). Ascorbate is synthesised de novo within a few hours of imbibition resulting in rapid increases in the ascorbate pool in the developing embryo. The knock-on effects of enhanced oxidation on embryo development before and after imbibition remain poorly characterised. A T-DNA insertional mutant line (SAIL_769_H05) line was used in these studies together with vtc2-1 mutants that were originally identified in an ethyl-methanesulfonate (EMS) mutagenesis screen. Expression levels of dry seeds and imbibed seeds of the genotypes Col0, vtc2 (EMS) and vtc2.5 (SAIL_769_H05) were quantified using Illumina RNA-seq technology Less...

PRJNA415344	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Epigenetic regulation of light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis by IBM1 histone demethylase in Arabidopsis	In Arabidopsis and other species, anthocyanin accumulation specifically depends on light signaling. The CONSTITUTIVELY PHOTOMORPHOGENIC1/SUPPRESSOR OF PHYA-105 (COP1/SPA) complex is required for the control of anthocyanin biosynthesis in response to light, but the precise mechanism underlying this process is largely unknown. Here we report that Increase in BONSAI Methylation 1 (IBM1), a JmjC domain-containing histone demethylase, participates in the regulation of light-induced anthocyanin biosynthesis in Arabidopsis. Loss-of-function mutations of IBM1 lead to accelerated anthocyanin accumulation in high light. We further identified that IBM1 is directly associated with SPA1/2/3 chromatin in vivo, whereas knockout of IBM1 resulted in an elevated level of H3K9 methylation and DNA non-CG sites within SPA genes, thereby repressing their expression. Transgenic ibm1 plants overexpressing SPA1 demonstrated that SPA1 was capable of complementing the mutant phenotype. Our results reveal a novel mechanism that controls the epigenetic regulation of anthocyanin biosynthesis and offer insight into how plant adapt to high light stress. This study could contribute to a better understanding of the linkage between light signaling and anthocyanin biosynthesis in plants Less...

PRJNA384933	Mutation of Arabidopsis SMC4 identifies condensin as a co-repressor of pericentromeric transposons, flowering, and DNA repair genes	In eukaryotes, transcriptionally inactive loci are enriched within highly condensed heterochromatin. In plants, as in mammals, the DNA of heterochromatin is densely methylated and wrapped by histones displaying a characteristic subset of post-translational modifications. Growing evidence indicates that these chromatin modifications are not sufficient for silencing. Instead, they are prerequisites for further assembly of higher-order chromatin structures that are refractory to transcription, but not fully understood. We show that silencing of transposons in the pericentromeric heterochromatin of Arabidopsis thaliana requires SMC4, a core subunit of condensins I and II, acting downstream of CG methylation by MET1 (DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1) and CHG methylation by CMT3 (CHROMOMETHYLASE 3), enabled by the chromatin remodeler DDM1 (DECREASE IN DNA METHYLATION 1). SMC4/condensin also acts within the mostly euchromatic chromosome arms to suppress conditionally-expressed genes involved in flowering or DNA repair, including the DNA glycosylase ROS1, which facilitates DNA demethylation. Collectively, our genome-wide analyses implicate condensin in the suppression of hundreds of loci, acting in both DNA methylation-dependent and methylation-independent pathways. Less...	
PRJNA380541	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Epistatic and allelic interactions control expression of ribosomal RNA gene clusters in Arabidopsis thaliana	Ribosomal RNA (rRNA) accounts for the majority of the RNA in eukaryotic cells, and is encoded by hundreds to thousands of nearly identical gene copies, only a subset of which are active at any given time. In Arabidopsis thaliana, 45S rRNA genes are found in two large rDNA clusters, and little is known about the contribution of each to the overall transcription. Taking advantage of genome sequencing data from the 1001 Genomes Consortium we found rRNA gene sequence variation within and among accessions, including within the highly conserved ribosomal subunits, and used linkage mapping in experimental populations to assign these variants to a particular rDNA cluster unambiguously. Using these markers, we demonstrated that rDNA cluster-usage varies greatly among accessions and that rDNA cluster-specific expression and silencing is controlled via interaction between entire rDNA cluster haplotypes (alleles).

The relatively distant phylogenetic relationships among the species involved in our heterografting system allowed easier distinguishment of scion mRNAs from the rootstock; in addition, the easiness of transformation for these species is another advantage if the molecular and physiological functional characterization of the identified mRNAs is a future research pursuit. Furthermore, we used this system to experimentally test: 1) whether the abundance of mRNAs in leaf is a deciding factor for the mobility of mRNAs; 2) whether the movement of mRNAs is under selection; 3) whether mobile mRNAs undergo degradation during their movement from shoot to root; 4) whether a shoot-to-root-shoot cycling process exists. In addition to the N. benthamiana/tomato heterografting system, we also developed another heterografting system in which canola is the scion and Arabidopsis is the rootstock. Our trial experiment showed that this is a valid system to identify shoot-to-root mobile mRNAs although more improvement is needed for this system. Less...

PRJNA416765	Next Generation RNA Sequencing reveals defects in nuclear mRNA maturation of Arabidopsis thaliana lefko2 mutant	Introduction: The Plant Organelle RNA Recognition (PORR) domain proteins are nucleus-encoded RNA-binding proteins that have acquired specific roles in organelle RNA metabolism as splicing factors of chloroplast group II introns. LEFKOTHEA (At5g62990) is a nuclear gene encoding a PORR domain protein that carries a transit peptide (TP) and monopartite or bipartite nuclear localization signals (NLS). These motifs result in dual-targeting of LEFKOTHEA to the nucleus and chloroplasts implying a role in the splicing of chloroplast group II introns and nuclear pre-mRNA introns. Therefore, we examined the splicing efficiency of plastid and nuclear genes in lefko2 mutant.Methods: The lefko2 mutant was isolated from a genetic screen of an M2 EMS-mutagenized Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia (Col-0) background seed population. The lefko2 mutant allele has a white cotyledon phenotype caused by a G to A mutation in the coding region resulting in a Glycine (G) 373 to Aspartic acid (D) conversion. Total RNA was extracted using plant RNA kit spin columns with an on-column DNase treatment from lefko2 mutant and wild-type Arabidopsis cotyledons. The quantity and integrity of the RNA was assessed using a NanoDrop 1000 spectrophotometer and agarose gel electrophoresis. RNA-seq libraries were generated using the TruSeq Low Input kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 instrument at BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute). Raw reads were filtered into clean reads and aligned to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10). RNA-seq data were analyzed using the SOAP (Release 2.121) with parameters “-s 40 -l 32 -v 3 -r 2” and the TopHat/Cufflinks pipeline (version 2) with parameters “-p 16 --solexa1.3-quals --segment-length 30 --segment-mismatches 2 -r 20 --mate-std-dev 20 --library-type fr-unstranded”. We generated 480 million paired-end reads (101 bp in length) for each sample. On average, about 90% of these reads could be unambiguously aligned to the TAIR10 reference genome sequence. Alternative splicing events were detected for lefko2 and wild-type using Spladder. Intron retention events detected in wild-type were filtered out from lefko2 or vice-versa, and visualized using the Integrative Genomics Viewer (IGV) tool.Results: Splicing defects were observed in numerous nuclear genes of lefko2 cotyledons compared to wild type. Among them, intron retention (IR) events were the most prominent. Further, the fidelity of 5’ splice site (5’SS) donor and 3’SS acceptor splicing was disturbed in lefko2 cotyledons. To less extend, exon skipping (ES) defects were also detected.Conclusions: Detailed nuclear splicing events were widely observed in lefko2 cotyledons demonstrating a prevalent role of LEFKOTHEA in the splicing of nuclear pre-mRNA introns.Overall design: RNA-seq libraries were generated using the TruSeq Low Input kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions (Illumina). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2500 instrument at BGI (Beijing Genomics Institute). Less...

Although not yet studied in plants, these proteins have been have been shown in other organisms to be, respectively, a spliceosome-associated protein kinase and a factor involved nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of mRNA. To understand further the roles of PRP4Ka and SAC3a in transcription and alternative splicing in Arabidopsis, we analyzed RNA-seq data from selected prp4ka and sac3a mutants to identify differentially expressed genes and changes in alternative splicing patterns. To investigate protein substrates of PRP4Ka, we carried out iTRAQ phosphoproteomics using proteins extracted from a prp4ka mutant and wild-type plants. Analysis of the collective results will increase knowledge of previously uncharacterized splicing factors in plants. Less...

Here we report that the redox-sensitive protein bZIP68 is localized to the nucleus under normal conditions in Arabidopsis seedlings. Upon oxidative stress treatment, some bZIP68 molecules became cytosolic. This oxidative stress-induced nucleocytoplasmic shuttling is dependent on the redox-sensitive Cys320 residue of bZIP68. The bzip68 mutant seedlings displayed aberrant growth responses to exogenously applied soluble sugar (sucrose, glucose, or trehalose) and showed altered tolerance to oxidative stress in a sugar-dependent manner. Our study indicated that bZIP68 normally suppresses expression of stress tolerance genes to promote growth, whereas its inactivation enhances stress tolerance but suppresses growth. bZIP68 might balances stress tolerance with growth through the extent of its oxidative inactivation according to the environment.

PRJEB6701	Interspecies_methylomeEvolution of DNA methylation patterns in the Brassicaceae is driven by differences in genome organization	"DNA methylation is an ancient molecular modification found in most eukaryotes. In plants, DNA methylation is not only critical for transcriptionally silencing transposons, but can also affect phenotype by altering expression of protein-coding genes. The extent of its contribution to phenotypic diversity over evolutionary time is, however, unclear, because of limited stability of epialleles that are not linked to DNA mutations. To dissect the relative contribution of DNA methylation to transposon surveillance and host gene regulation, we leveraged information from three species in the Brassicaceae that vary in genome architecture, Capsella rubella, Arabidopsis lyrata, and Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that the lineage-specific expansion and contraction of transposon and repeat sequences is the main driver of interspecific differences in DNA methylation. The most heavily methylated portions of the genome are thus not conserved at the sequence level. Outside of repeat-associated methylation, there is a surprising degree of conservation in methylation at single nucleotides located in gene bodies. Finally, dynamic DNA methylation is affected more by tissue type than by environmental differences in all species, but these responses are not conserved. The majority of DNA methylation variation between species resides in hypervariable genomic regions and thus, in the context of macroevolution, is of limited phenotypic consequence.

Plants evolved multifaceted nitrate responses to modulate global gene expression, metabolism and developmental programs. However, primary nitrate signaling mechanisms remained elusive. Using an ultrasensitive Ca2+ biosensor, unique nitrate-induced Ca2+ signaling was illuminated in Arabidopsis cells and plants. Integrative functional genomic screens, chemical genetics, genome-wide transcript sequencing, and analyses of nitrate-associated traits uncovered the surprising roles of Ca2+ sensor protein kinases (CPKs) in orchestrating diverse primary and long-term nitrate responses. Nitrate specifies CPK signaling to reprogram transcriptome and govern N-assimilation, metabolism, transport, hormones, shoot growth, and root system architecture. CPKs may be targeted to enhance nitrogen-use-efficiency, reduce fertilizer demands, and alleviate ecosystem pollution.

These mainly focusing Arabidopsis thaliana threatened by (hemi-)biotrophic pathogens such as the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. Here, we show that the Arabidopsis miRNA pathway is important for defense responses against the necrotrophic fungus Alternaria brassicicola. The miRNA pathway mutant ago1 exhibits an exaggerated response when treated with A. brassicicola, proposing that AGO1 is positive regulator. We found a subset of Arabidopsis miRNAs that quickly change their expression and their abundance in AGO1 complexes in plants exposed to A. brassicicola. The miRNAs responding to pathogen treatment are mainly targeting genes encoding metabolic enzymes, proteins involved protein degradation or transposons. In case of miR163, A. brassicicola infection results in increased levels of miRNA precursors and preferential accumulation of an unspliced form of pri-miR163, suggesting that A. brassicicola infection changes the transcriptional and post-regulation of pri-miRNAs. miR163 acts as a negative regulator of plant defense because mir163 mutants are more resistant when treated with A. brassicicola. Taken together, our results reveal the existence of positively and negatively acting Arabidopsis miRNA modulating the defense responses against A. brassicicola and highlight the importance of host miRNAs in the interaction between plants and necrotrophic pathogens.

PRJNA326338	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The MBD7 complex promotes expression of methylated transgenes without significantly altering their methylation status (mRNA-seq)	"DNA methylation is a chromatin modification that is associated with gene silencing in eukaryotic organisms. Although pathways controlling the establishment, maintenance and removal of DNA methylation have been identified, relatively little is understood about how DNA methylation influences gene expression. Using complementary genetic and biochemical approaches we identified a protein complex that antagonizes the transcriptional gene silencing of two LUCIFERASE (LUC) reporters in a manner that requires DNA methylation. At its core, this complex contains LOW IN LUCIFERASE EXPRESSION (LIL), an α-crystallin domain protein, and METHYL-CpG-BINDING DOMAIN 7 (MBD7), a protein previously associated with DNA methylation. At the LUC reporters, loss of MBD7 or LIL resulted in decreased LUC expression concomitant with modest, but reproducible increases in DNA methylation that can be phenocopied by DNA demethylase mutants. These findings are consistent with other reports and reveal a genetic connection between MBD7, LIL and DNA demethylation. However, we found that the hyper-methylation and gene expression phenotypes at a LUC reporter can be genetically uncoupled, demonstrating that changes in DNA methylation alone are not sufficient to silence LUC expression, and suggesting a role for the MBD7-LIL complex downstream of DNA methylation. Consistent with this hypothesis, our more extensive analysis of DNA methylation in mbd7 and lil mutants revealed only a small number of hyper-methylated loci genome wide. Furthermore, these loci displayed minimal overlap with demethylase targets, suggesting that, in general, the DNA demethylation machinery does not function in a manner dependent on the MBD7-LIL complex. Taken together, our findings place the MBD7-LIL complex amongst a small number of factors that regulate gene expression without causing significant changes in DNA methylation. This complex, however, is unique in that it functions to suppress, rather than enforce the silencing effects of DNA methylation, enabling gene expression of several transgene reporters despite high levels of promoter methylation.

PRJNA326392	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The Arabidopsis Polycomb Repressive Complex 1 (PRC1) components AtBMI1A, B and C impact gene networks throughout all stages of plant development	"PcG regulation in Arabidopsis is required to maintain cell differentiation and to allow developmental phase transitions. This is achieved by the activity of three PRC2s and the participation of a yet poorly defined PRC1. Previous results showed that apparent PRC1 components perform discrete roles during plant development, suggesting the existence of PRC1 variants; however, it is not clear in how many processes these components participate. We show that AtBMI1 proteins are required to promote all developmental phase transitions and to control cell proliferation during organ growth and development, expanding their proposed range of action. While AtBMI1 function during germination is closely linked to B3 domain transcription factors VAL1/2 possibly in combination with GT-box binding factors, other AtBMI1 regulatory networks require participation of different factor combinations. Conversely, EMF1 and LHP1 bind many H3K27me3 positive genes upregulated in atbmi1a/b/c mutants; however, loss of their function affects expression of a different subset, suggesting that even if EMF1, LHP1 and AtBMI1 exist in a common PRC1 variant, their role in repression depends on the functional context.

We examined the gene expression in roots and shoots of wild type (Col) and cbp20 mutant (in Col background).
Ethylene is one of the most essential hormones for plant developmental processes and stress responses. EIN2 is a key factor in ethylene signaling pathway and its function is regulated by phosphorylation. However, the phosphorylation regulation in the ethylene signaling pathway is largely unknown. Here we report the phosphorylation of CBP20 is regulated by ethylene, and the phosphorylation is involved in root elongation. The constitutive phosphorylation format of CBP20 rescues the cbp20 root ethylene hyposensitive phenotype, while the constitutive de-phosphorylation format of CBP20 is unable to rescue the root phenotype of cbp20 in response to ethylene. Genome wide study on ethylene regulated gene expression and microRNA expression in the roots and shoots of both Col and cbp20, together with the result of genetics validation suggest that ethylene induced phosphorylation of CBP20 is involved in root growth and one pathway is through the regulation of  microRNAs and their target genes in roots.

PRJNA326566	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Loss of the DNA methyltransferase MET1 induces H3K9 hypermethylation at PcG target genes in Arabidopsis, and relocation of H3K27 trimethylation to transposons [RNA-seq]	"Dimethylation of histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9m2) and trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27m3) are two hallmarks of transcriptional repression in many organisms. In Arabidopsis thaliana, H3K27m3 is targeted by Polycomb Group (PcG) proteins and is associated with silent protein coding genes, while H3K9m2 is correlated with DNA methylation and is associated with transposons and repetitive sequences. Recently, ectopic genic DNA methylation in the CHG context (where H is any base except G) has been observed in globally DNA hypomethylated mutants such as met1, but neither the nature of the hypermethylated loci nor the biological significance of this epigenetic phenomenon have been investigated. Here, we generated high-resolution genome-wide maps of both H3K9m2 and H3K27m3 in wild type and met1 plants, which we integrated with transcriptional data, to explore the relationships between these two marks. We found that most of the ectopic H3K9m2 observed in met1 is not due to defects in IBM1-mediated H3K9m2 demethylation, but instead targets H3K27m3-marked genes suggesting an interplay between these two silencing marks. Furthermore, H3K9m2/DNA-hypermethylation at these PcG targets in met1 is coupled with a decrease in H3K27m3 marks, whearas H3K9m2 hypomethylated transposons become ectopically H3K27me3 hypermethylated. Our results bear interesting similarities with cancer cells, which show global losses of DNA methylation, but ectopic hypermethylation of genes previously marked by H3K27m3.

Cold acclimation has been shown to be attenuated by the degradation of the INDUCER OF CBF EXPRESSION1 protein by the E3 ubiquitin ligase HIGH EXPRESSION OF OSMOTICALLY RESPONSIVE GENES1 (HOS1). However, recent work has suggested that HOS1 may have a wider range of roles in plants than previously appreciated. Here, we show that hos1 mutants are affected in circadian clock function, exhibiting a long-period phenotype in a wide range of temperature and light environments. We demonstrate that hos1 mutants accumulate polyadenylated mRNA in the nucleus and that the circadian defect in hos1 is shared by multiple mutants with aberrant mRNA export, but not in a mutant attenuated in nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of microRNAs. As revealed by RNA sequencing, hos1 exhibits gross changes to the transcriptome with genes in multiple functional categories being affected. In addition, we show that hos1 and other previously described mutants with altered mRNA export affect cold signaling in a similar manner. Our data support a model in which altered mRNA export is important for the manifestation of hos1 circadian clock defects and suggest that HOS1 may indirectly affect cold signaling through disruption of the circadian clock [PMID: 24254125]

PRJNA330623	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Cytoplasmic Control of Plastid Retrograde Signaling by SCFDIF-Mediated Degradation of DIFFERENTIATION AND GREENING-LIKE	"Purpose: In plants, chloroplasts not only fix energy through photosynthesis, but they synthesize numerous metabolites which can act as important growth regulators by impacting nuclear gene expression.  Upon developmental and external stimuli, signaling between the nucleus and chloroplasts is essential for maintaining plant cellular homeostasis.  In this study, we applied an Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform to investigate the transcriptome changes of 2 Arabidopsis thaliana mutant lines, a T-DNA knock out muant allele of DIFFERENTIAL AND GREENING-LIKE (DAL), termed dal-2, and a dexmathasone (Dex)-induced overexpression line of DAL-INTERACTING F-BOX  (termed DIF-OX2).
Methods: Total RNA was isolated from 12-d-old Col-0 (wild type control) and DIF-OX2 seedlings grown on Gamborg’s B-5 (GM) medium containing 1% sucrose (GM-Suc), with or without 10 μM Dex, and 20-d-old dal-2 plants also grown on GM-Suc medium, and deep sequenced as 100-mers using the Illumina HiSeq 2500 platform (DNA Sequencing Facility, University of Wisconsin Biotechnology Center).  Raw image files for each library were converted to FASTQ files by the standard Illumina pipeline and processed for quality control by Trimmomatic (http://www.usadellab.org/cms/?page=trimmomatic) to remove adapter and low quality sequences (phred=33, minimum length=36).  Processed sequences were aligned to the A. thaliana Col-0 genomic sequence (from The Arabidopsis Information Resource (TAIR) version 10 at http://www.arabidopsis.org) via TOPHAT2 to identify accepted hits, which were then used to generate an absolute expression level (counts) of each locus by HTSeq (http://www-huber.embl.de/users/anders/HTSeq/).  The resulting counts per locus were normalized to counts per million reads (CPM) among all 10 libraries and used to generate the list of differentially expressed (DE) genes between treatments or genotypes by edgeR (FDR < 5% or ABS[log2FoldChange (FC)] ≥ 1).
Results: In total, 6,743 differentially expressed (DE) RNAs were identified using edgeR (FDR < 5%) in either dal-2 or DIF-OX2 (+Dex) seedlings, as compared to Dex-untreated or Dex-treated wild-type seedlings, respectively.  Among these DE genes, the expression levels of 2,606 loci in dal-2 changed at a level greater than or equal to 2 fold compared to those in the Dex-untreated wild type control, but showed a strong positive correlation with their expression levels in DIF-OX2 (+Dex) (Spearman’s rank correlation rho = 0.72, p < 2.2e-16; Figure 5B-C).
Conclusions: The similar transcriptome changes in both DIF-OX2 (+Dex) and dal-2 plants suggests that the DIF and DAL proteins are involved in the same pathway, which controls a retrograde signaling from chloroplasts to the nucleus, based on further biochemical analysis, cellular localization, and transcriptome comparisons with other public available microarray data from mutants impacting chloroplast retrograde signaling.

Basing on the criteria of 1.5-fold cutoff for the genes with 5% false discovery rate, we first identified the differentially expressed genes in Col_PAC vs Col_mock, nf-ycT_PAC vs Col_PAC, and rgl2_PAC vs Col_PAC subsets, which are referred to as PAC-, NF-YC-, and RGL2-regulated genes.These data reveal that NF-YCs and RGL2 co-target a set of common genes in response to phytohormone signals, strongly supporting the role of NF-YC-RGL2 in seed germination regulation.

However, the complexity of the RNA degradome beyond miRNA targets is currently largely unclear which limits the application of RNA degradome. Here, we provide multiple lines of evidence to show that the plant RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments. We observed a 3-nt periodicity and a bias toward the translational frame in the global analysis of 5' truncated mRNA ends mapped to the coding sequence (CDS) of Arabidopsis (Arabidopsis thaliana), rice (Oryza sativa) and soybean (Glycine max). In addition, predominant 5' termini of RNA degradation intermediates separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected mRNA fragment were evident in some conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs) of Arabidopsis and rice. Through the analysis of RNA degradome data, we uncovered novel uORFs and CDS regions potentially associated with stacked ribosomes in Arabidopsis. Furthermore, the analysis of RNA degradome data suggested that the binding of Arabidopsis ARGONAUTE7 to a non-cleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work demonstrates an alternative use of RNA degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling.

PRJEB14313	Retrograde signalling during caused by heritable mitochondrial dysfunction is partly mediated by ANAC017 and improves plant performance.	Mitochondria are crucial for plant viability and are able to communicate information on their functional status to the cellular nucleus via retrograde signalling, thereby affecting gene expression. It is currently unclear if retrograde signalling in response to constitutive mitochondrial biogenesis defects is mediated by the same pathways as those triggered during acute mitochondrial dysfunction. Furthermore, it is unknown if retrograde signalling can effectively improve plant performance when mitochondrial function is constitutively impaired.  Here we show that retrograde signalling in mutants defective in mitochondrial proteins RNA polymerase rpotmp or prohibitin atphb3 can be suppressed by knocking out the transcription factor ANAC017. Genome-wide RNA-seq expression analysis revealed that ANAC017 is almost solely responsible for the most dramatic transcriptional changes common to rpotmp and atphb3 mutants, regulating both classical marker genes such as alternative oxidase 1a (AOX1a) and also previously-uncharacterised DUF295 genes that appear to be new retrograde markers. In contrast, ANAC017 does not regulate intra-mitochondrial gene expression or transcriptional changes unique to either rpotmp or atphb3 genotype, suggesting the existence of currently unknown signalling cascades. The data show that the role of ANAC017 extends beyond common retrograde transcriptional responses and affects downstream protein abundance and enzyme activity of alternative oxidase, as well as steady state energy metabolism in atphb3 plants. Furthermore, detailed growth analysis revealed that ANAC017-dependent retrograde signalling provides benefits for growth and productivity in plants with mitochondrial defects. In conclusion, ANAC017 plays a key role in both biogenic and operational mitochondrial retrograde signalling, and improves plant performance when mitochondrial function is constitutively impaired.

Most Arabidopsis ecotypes are highly susceptible to TCV, except for the TCV resistant line Di-17 derived from ecotype Dijon.

Besides the virus-triggered genes, small RNAs also play critical roles in plant defense by triggering either transcriptional and/or post-transcriptional gene silencing.

PRJNA336152	H2A.Z in drought stress	Response to abiotic stresses involves different regulatory mechanisms of gene expression. Chromatin states may contribute to the stress response, however, our understanding of their role in this process remains elusive. Here, by analysis of the arp6 mutant, which is impaired in deposition of the histone variant H2A.Z, and by H2A.Z profiling in abiotic stress conditions we investigated the impact of this histone variant on the expression of stress-related genes. We demonstrate that the arp6 mutant exhibits phenotypic defects in response to osmotic stresses, indicating a misregulation of corresponding genes. Indeed, RNA-sequencing revealed that among genes upregulated in arp6 the stress-responsive group is overrepresented. Genes upregulated in arp6 exhibit high levels of H2A.Z in gene bodies. Furthermore, we observed that H2A.Z distribution in genes induced and repressed in stress conditions significantly differs from that of constitutively active genes, and H2A.Z distribution does not change upon transcriptional activation or repression. However, occupancy of H2A.Z changes in parallel to gene transcriptional changes. In particular, we observed H2A.Z loss upon transcriptional activation and H2A.Z gain upon repression, which is consistent with a repressive role of H2A.Z in gene expression. In addition, our data indicate that H2A.Z at the first nucleosome downstream from transcription start site (+1) facilitates transcription initiation for constitutive and stress-repressed genes, but is less important for stress-induced genes. We propose that longer nucleosome depleted regions of stress-induced genes are responsible for binding additional transcription co-activators to overcome the +1 nucleosome barrier upon induction.

PRJNA336053	Arabidopsis thaliana, Arabidopsis lyrata, Capsella rubellaEvolutionary Fates and Dynamic Functionalization of Young Duplicate Genes in Arabidopsis Genomes	Gene duplication is a primary means to generate genomic novelties, playing an essential role in speciation and adaptation. Particularly in plants, a high abundance of duplicate genes have been maintained for significantly long periods of evolutionary time. To address the manner in which young duplicate genes were primarily derived from small-scale gene duplication and preserved in plant genomes and to determine the underlying driving mechanisms, we generated transcriptomes to produce the expression profiles of five tissues in Arabidopsis thaliana and the closely related species A. lyrata and Capsella rubella. Based on the quantitative analysis metrics, we investigated the evolutionary processes of young duplicate genes in Arabidopsis.We determined that conservation, neofunctionalization, and specialization are three main evolutionary processes for Arabidopsis young duplicate genes. We explicitly demonstrated the dynamic functionalization of duplicate genes along with evolutionary time scale. Upon origination, duplicates tend to maintain their ancestral functions; but as they survive longer, they might be likely to develop distinct and novel functions. The temporal evolutionary processes and functionalization of plant duplicate genes are associated with their ancestral functions, dynamic DNA methylation levels, and histone modification abundances. Furthermore, duplicate genes tend to be initially expressed in pollen and then to gain more interaction partners over time. Altogether, our study provides novel insights into the dynamic retention processes of young duplicate genes in plant genomes. Less...

PRJNA336549	Combining ATAC-seq with nuclei sorting for discovery of cis-regulatory regions in plant genomes	"Chromatin structure plays a pivotal role in facilitating proper control of gene expression. The ability of transcription factors (TF) to bind cis-elements is often associated with accessible chromatin regions. Therefore, identification of these accessible regions throughout plant genomes is important to understanding the relationship between TF binding, chromatin status and the regulation of gene expression. Assay for Transposase Accessible Chromatin sequencing (ATAC-seq) is a recently developed technique used to map open chromatin zones in animal genomes. However, in plants, the existence of cell walls, subcellular organelles and the lack of stable cell lines have prevented routine application of this technique. Here, we describe an assay combining ATAC-seq with Fluorescence-Activated Nuclei Sorting (FANS) to identify and map open chromatin and TF-binding sites in plant genomes. FANS-ATAC-seq compares favorably with published DNaseI sequencing (DNase-seq) results and it only requires 500-50,000 nuclei for accurate identification of open chromatin states.
Overall design: Chromatin accessibility profiling (FANS-ATAC-seq) data collected from Arabidopsis 7-day old Col-0 whole seedlings, roots, 35S:H2AX-GFP/Col-0 whole seedlings, or 10-day old maize B73 overground parts. Replicates are included when available.

Results: Using an optimized data analysis workflow, we mapped about 100 million sequence reads per sample to the Arabidopsis genome (TAIR10) and identified 1495 differentially expressed genes between Col-0 and mutant dark samples; 1361 differentially expressed genes between Col-0 and mutant red light treated samples; 4291 differentially expressed genes between Col-0 dark and red light treated samples; and 4479 differentially expressed genes between mutant dark and red light treated samples. Except for gene expression, we also discovered 788 differentially spliced bins between Col-0 and mutant dark samples; 827 differentially spliced bins between Col-0 and mutant red light treated samples; 610 differentially spliced bins between Col-0 dark and red light treated samples; and 405 differentially spliced bins between mutant dark and red light treated samples. Altered splicing of 9 genes was confirmed with qRT-PCR, demonstrating the high degree of sensitivity of the RNA-seq method.
Conclusions: Our study represents the first detailed analysis of SFPS mutant transcriptomes, with biologic replicates, generated by RNA-seq technology. Our results show that SFPS regulates photomorphogenesis in Arabidopisis through regulating the splicing activity of light signaling genes, which helps us.

PRJNA339870	Global studies of eIF5B function in Arabidopsis	The translation initiation factor eIF5B is a GTPase that acts late in the translation initiation process and is one of two universally conserved translation initiation factors. However, the molecular mechanism by which eIF5B is involved in plant development and environmental response remains unknown. In this study, we found that a missense mutation in an eIF5B gene in Arabidopsis thaliana (eIF5B-1; At1g76810) prevents acclimation to high temperature and that severe alleles have multiple growth defects. Surprisingly, Arabidopsis has three other eIF5B genes, none of which is capable of substituting for eIF5B-1 in thermotolerance or growth. One of these other genes, eIF5B-2 (At1g21160) shows differences in level and tissue distribution of expression explaining its inability to complement the eIF5B-1 mutants. The other two genes, eIF5B-3 (At1g76720) and eIF5B-4 (At1g76820) have clearly undergone evolutionary conversion to a non-functional state. The thermotolerance-defective eIF5B-1 allele, a Ser substitution of a highly conserved Gly residue in Domain II, grows normally in the absence of stress. However, polysome profiling and RNA-seq analysis show delayed recovery of translation after heat stress and reduced polysome loading of certain heat shock protein (HSP) mRNAs. A second mutant allele that truncates eIF5B-1 by 30 aa, shows a significantly reduced growth rate. Polysome profiling reveals a dramatic increase in small polysomes and selective changes in polysome loading in the truncation mutant compared to wild type. RNA-seq data suggest that the mutant selectively decreases translation efficiency of auxin and ribosome related genes. We speculate that the phenotypes of these eIF5B-1 mutants result from the requirement for optimal eIF5B activity for translation of specific mRNAs, rather than arising solely from reduced overall translation initiation.

PRJNA341458	Phytochromes function as thermosensors in Arabidopsis	Plants are responsive to temperature, and can distinguish differences of 1ºC. In Arabidopsis, warmer temperature accelerates flowering and increases elongation growth (thermomorphogenesis). The mechanisms of temperature perception are however largely unknown. We describe a major thermosensory role for the phytochromes (red light receptors) during the night. Phytochrome null plants display a constitutive warm temperature response, and consistent with this, we show in this background that the warm temperature transcriptome becomes de-repressed at low temperatures. We have discovered PHYB directly associates with the promoters of key target genes in a temperature dependent manner. The rate of PHYB inactivation is proportional to temperature in the dark, enabling phytochromes to function as thermal timers, integrating temperature information over the course of the night.

We carried out a genome-wide analysis of mRNA decay rates using wild-type Arabidopsis and mutants with defects in mRNA decapping and SOV/DIS3L2.  Decay rates and contributions of decapping and SOV to decay were estimated for 18,674 mRNAs using maximum likelihood modeling. Most mRNAs decayed by multiple pathways, few mRNAs degraded exclusively by mRNA decapping or SOV, and specific codon usage was linked to decay rates. Unexpected faster decay of transcripts in some genotypes was found to be independent of siRNAs; instead the data suggested an RNA buffering-like phenomenon in Arabidopsis, and that VCS (decapping) is essential for both this process and the decay of very unstable mRNAs.

Although the transcriptional programs regulating these events are well studied, post-transcriptional factors functioning in this cell fate decision are mostly unknown. Here, we globally identify RNA-protein interactions and RNA secondary structure in hair and nonhair cell nuclei. This analysis reveals distinct structural and protein binding patterns across both transcriptomes, allowing identification of differential RNA binding protein (RBP) recognition sites. Using these sequences, we identify two RBPs that regulate hair cell development. Specifically, we find that SERRATE functions in a microRNA-dependent manner to inhibit hair cell fate, while also terminating hair growth in differentiated hair cells independent of microRNAs. Additionally, we show that GLYCINE-RICH PROTEIN 8 alleviates phosphate starvation stress while promoting hair cell fate.

By comparing the response of wild-type plants and mutants impaired in photorespiration to a shift in ambient CO2 concentrations, we demonstrate that photorespiration also plays a beneficial role during short-term acclimation to reduced CO2 availability. Wild-type plants responded with few differentially expressed genes, mostly involved in drought stress, which is likely a consequence of enhanced opening of stomata and concomitant water loss upon shift toward low CO2. In contrast, mutants with impaired activity of photorespiratory enzymes were highly stressed and not able to adjust stomatal conductance to reduced external CO2 availability. The mutants´ transcriptional response was congruent, indicating a general reprogramming to deal with the consequences of reduced CO2 availability, signaled by enhanced oxygenation of ribulose-1,5 bisphosphate and amplified by the artificially impaired photorespiratory metabolism. Central in this reprogramming was the pronounced reallocation of resources from growth processes to stress responses. In conclusion, we demonstrate that unrestricted photorespiratory metabolism is a prerequisite for rapid physiological acclimation to a reduction in CO2 availability.

PRJNA348676	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Time-resolved transcriptome analysis with genetic perturbations reveals a critical time window for effective plant immunity	"Pathogen invasion in plants is associated with transcriptional reprogramming. Enigmatically, plants induce similar transcriptome responses upon infection by virulent or avirulent pathogens. This renders the importance of transcriptional reprogramming for immunity obscure. Here, using RNA-seq, we generate time-series transcriptome data coupled with genetic perturbations to reveal temporal dynamics upon infection by virulent or avirulent strains of a bacterial pathogen, Pseudomonas syringae, in Arabidopsis thaliana. Fast and sustained transcriptional reprogramming occurs upon infection with avirulent strains while virulent strain infection leads to a slower response with comparable gene expression patterns and magnitudes. Importantly, transcriptome analysis of resistant and susceptible mutants responding to avirulent strains links delayed transcriptional reprogramming to compromised immunity. Taken together, our results pinpoint the early critical time window of transcriptional reprogramming for establishing effective immunity against the bacterial pathogen.
Overall design: Leaves of Col-0 and all the single, double, triple and quadruple mutants of dde2-2, ein2-1, pad4-1, sid2-2 were syringe-infiltrated with mock (water) or suspensions of Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato DC3000 (Pto DC3000) carrying an empty vector (pLAFR), Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpt2, or Pto DC3000 carrying AvrRpm1 at the OD600 of 0.001.

PRJNA351872	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)H2A monoubiquitination in Arabidopsis is generally independent of LHP1 and PRC2 activity [RNA-seq]	"BACKGROUND:
Polycomb group complexes PRC1 and PRC2 repress gene expression at the chromatin level in eukaryotes. The classic recruitment model of Polycomb group complexes in which PRC2-mediated H3K27 trimethylation recruits PRC1 for H2A monoubiquitination was recently challenged by data showing that PRC1 activity can also recruit PRC2. However, the prevalence of these two mechanisms is unknown, especially in plants as H2AK121ub marks were examined at only a handful of Polycomb group targets.
RESULTS:
By using genome-wide analyses, we show that H2AK121ub marks are surprisingly widespread in Arabidopsis thaliana, often co-localizing with H3K27me3 but also occupying a set of transcriptionally active genes devoid of H3K27me3. Furthermore, by profiling H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks in atbmi1a/b/c, clf/swn, and lhp1 mutants we found that PRC2 activity is not required for H2AK121ub marking at most genes. In contrast, loss of AtBMI1 function impacts the incorporation of H3K27me3 marks at most Polycomb group targets.
CONCLUSIONS:
Our findings show the relationship between H2AK121ub and H3K27me3 marks across the A. thaliana genome and unveil that ubiquitination by PRC1 is largely independent of PRC2 activity in plants, while the inverse is true for H3K27 trimethylation.

In plants, an analogous period of prolonged maternal control over embryogenesis is thought to occur based on gene-expression studies. However, other gene-expression studies and genetic analyses show that some transcripts must derive from the early zygotic genome, implying that the prevailing model does not fully explain the nature of zygotic genome activation in plants. To determine the maternal, paternal and zygotic contributions to the early embryonic transcriptome, we sequenced the transcripts of hybrid embryos from crosses between two polymorphic inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) diagnostic of each parental line to quantify parental contributions. Although some transcripts appeared to be either inherited from primarily one parent or transcribed from imprinted embryonic loci, the vast majority of transcripts were produced in near-equal amounts from both maternal and paternal alleles, even during the initial stages of embryogenesis. Results of reporter experiments and analyses of transcripts from genes that are not expressed in sperm and egg indicate early and widespread zygotic transcription. Thus, in contrast to early animal embryogenesis, early plant embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control. Less...

PRJNA352042	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)A single miR390 targeting event is sufficient for triggering TAS3-tasiRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis.	"In plants, tasiRNAs form a class of endogenous secondary siRNAs produced through the action of RNA-DEPENDENT-RNA-POLYMERASE-6 (RDR6) upon microRNA-mediated cleavage of non-coding TAS RNAs. In Arabidopsis thaliana, TAS1, TAS2 and TAS4 tasiRNA production proceeds via a single cleavage event mediated by 22nt-long or/and asymmetric miRNAs in an ARGONAUTE-1 (AGO1)-dependent manner. By contrast, tasiRNA production from TAS3 seems to follow the so-called ‘two-hit’ process, where dual targeting of TAS3, specifically mediated by the 21nt-long, symmetric miR390, initiates AGO7-dependent tasiRNA production. Interestingly, features for TAS3 tasiRNA production differ in other plant species and we show here that such features also enable TAS3 tasiRNA biogenesis in Arabidopsis, and that a single miR390 targeting event is, in fact, sufficient for this process, suggesting that the ‘one-hit’ model underpins all the necessary rudiments of secondary siRNA biogenesis from plant TAS transcripts. Further results suggest that the two-hit configuration likely enhances the fidelity of tasiRNA production and, hence, the accuracy of downstream gene regulation. Finally, we show that a ‘non-cleavable one-hit’ process allows tasiRNA production from both TAS1 and TAS3 transcripts, indicating that RDR6 recruitment does not require miRNA cleavage, nor does the recruitment, as we further show, of SUPRRESSOR-OF-GENE-SILENCING-3, indispensable for tasiRNA generation.
Overall design: We have analysed the sRNA populations from 5 different reporter lines designed to test the biogenesis of tasiRNAs from TAS3.

We noticed that some H. arabidopsidis effectors, when over-expressed in A. thaliana, render the plant more susceptible to infection by biotrophic pathogens (Fabro et al., 2011, PubMed PMID: 22072967). Here we performed transcriptome profiling of a representative transgenic line constitutively expressing H. arabidopsidis effector HaRxL106. We compared the transcriptomes of A. thaliana wild-type (Col-0) plants and an isogenic line expressing HaRxL106 before pathogen challenge and 24 h after infection with the compatible bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato strain DC3000.

PRJNA352201	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)SAC3B, a central component of the mRNA export complex TREX-2, is required for prevention of epigenetic gene silencing in Arabidopsis	"Epigenetic regulation is important for organismal development and response to the environment. Alteration in epigenetic status has been known mostly from the perspective of enzymatic actions of DNA methylation and/or histone modifications. In a genetic screen for cellular factors involved in preventing epigenetic silencing, we isolated an Arabidopsis mutant defective in SAC3B, a component of the conserved TREX-2 complex that couples mRNA transcription with nuleo-cytoplasmic export. Arabidopsis SAC3B dysfunction causes gene silencing at transgenic and endogenous loci, accompanied by elevation in the repressive histone mark H3K9me2 and by reduction in RNA polymerase Pol II occupancy. SAC3B dysfunction does not alter promoter DNA methylation level of the transgene d35S::LUC, although the DNA demethylase ROS1 is also required for d35S::LUC anti-silencing. THP1 and NUA were identified as SAC3B-associated proteins whose mutations also caused d35S::LUC silencing. RNA-DNA hybrid exists at the repressed loci but is unrelated to gene suppression by the sac3b mutation. Genomewide analyses demonstrated minor but clear involvement of SAC3B in regulating siRNAs and DNA methylation, particularly at a group of TAS and TAS-like loci. Together our results revealed not only a critical role of mRNA-export factors in transcriptional anti-silencing but also the contribution of SAC3B in shaping plant epigenetic landscapes.

PRJNA353122	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)POWERDERESS and HDA9 interact and promote histone H3 deacetylation at specific lysine residues in Arabidopsis. [RNA-Seq]	"Histone acetylation is a major epigenetic control mechanism that is tightly linked to the promotion of gene expression. Histone acetylation levels are balanced through the opposing activities of histone acetyltransferases (HATs) and histone deacetylases (HDACs). Arabidopsis HDAC genes (AtHDACs) compose a large gene family, and distinct phenotypes among AtHDAC mutants reflect the functional specificity of individual AtHDACs. However, the mechanisms underlying this functional diversity are largely unknown. Here, we show that POWERDRESS (PWR), a positive regulator of floral stem cell maintenance, interacts with HDA9 and promotes histone H3 deacetylation possibly by facilitating HDA9 function at target chromatin. The PWR SANT2 domain, which is homologous to that of subunits in animal HDAC complexes, showed specific binding affinity to acetylated histone H3. Three lysine residues (K9, K14 and K27) of H3 retained hyperacetylation status in both pwr and hda9 mutants. Genome wide H3K9 and H3K14 acetylation levels were generally elevated, and a large portion of acetylated targets overlapped between the pwr and hda9 mutants. Comparative analysis revealed a correlation between gene expression and histone H3 acetylation status in the pwr and hda9 mutants. In addition, PWR and HDA9 modulated the AGAMOUS-LIKE 19 (AGL19)-mediated flowering time pathway through histone H3 deacetylation. Finally, PWR was shown to physically interact with HDA9. We therefore propose that PWR acts as a subunit in a complex with HDA9 to negatively regulate the acetylation of specific lysine residues of histone H3 at genomic targets.

PRJNA356373	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Mechanism of early light signaling by the carboxy-terminal output module of Arabidopsis phytochrome B	"Phytochromes are evolutionarily conserved photoreceptors in bacteria, fungi, and plants. The prototypical phytochrome comprises an N-terminal photosensory module and a C-terminal histidine kinase signaling-output module. However, the plant phytochrome has been postulated to transduce light signals by interacting with a group of nodal Phytochrome-Interacting transcription Factors (PIFs) and triggering their degradation via the N-terminal photosensory module, while its C-terminal output module, including a Histidine Kinase-Related Domain (HKRD), is thought not to participate directly in signaling. Here, we show that the C-terminal module of Arabidopsis phytochrome B (PHYB) is unexpectedly sufficient to mediate the degradation of PIF3 and to induce a distinct set of PIF-regulated photosynthetic genes. These signaling functions require the HKRD and particularly its dimerization. A D1040V mutation, which disrupts the dimerization of HKRD and the interaction between the C-terminal module and PIF3, abrogates the early light signaling functions of PHYB in nuclear accumulation, photobody biogenesis, and PIF3 degradation. In contrast, disruption of the interaction between PIF3 and PHYB’s N-terminal photosensory module has little effect on PIF3 degradation. Together, this study provides novel insight into the central mechanism of early phytochrome signaling that the C-terminal signaling-output module of PHYB interacts with PIF3 in the nucleus to mediate PIF3 degradation by light.

PRJNA357201	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Regulatory inversion in NAC networks steers the timing of age-dependent cell death in plants [RNA-Seq]	"Aging is a time-dependent biological phenomenon governed by complex networks of regulatory components and their transitions over lifetime. Yet, there have been limited efforts to pin down age-associated networks and map their dynamic characteristics onto aging phenotypes. Here, we built time-course genetic regulatory networks of NAM/ATAF/CUC (NAC) transcription factors during the course of leaf aging in Arabidopsis, using causal regulatory relationships among NACs identified from mutants of 49 aging-associated NACs. These temporal networks revealed a regulatory inversion from activating to repressive regulatory modes at a pre-senescent stage. The inversion was governed by three hub NACs, and their mutants conferred earlier aging with altered expression of reactive oxygen species and salicylic acid response genes. Overexpression of the hub NACs delayed the regulatory inversion, rendering delayed age-dependent cell death. We conclude that the regulatory inversion in NAC networks at a pre-senescent stage directs when age-dependent cell death should proceed in plants.

Transposable elements (TEs) are widely distributed in many eukaryotic genomes, and often account for large fractions of plant and animal genomes. By using strand-specific RNA sequencing, we profiled the expression patterns of lincRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and identified TE-associated lincRNAs (TE-lincRNAs). Stress regulation of some TE-lincRNAs was observed in Arabidopsis. Our findings indicate that TE-associated lincRNAs potentially play important roles in plant abiotic stress responses. Moreover, in the Arabidopsis chromatin remodelling mutant ddm1 that has an altered chromatin state, novel lincRNAs including TE-lincRNAs were generated. The novel lincRNAs were inherited in the subsequent generations in the wild type background, suggesting that lincRNAs could act as an adaptive reservoir in eukaryotes.

PRJNA358016	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana mid torpedo embryo transcriptome of reciprocal Col-0/C24 triploid hybrids	Background: Imprinting is a phenomenon found in mammals and flowering plants in which genes are differentially expressed between parental alleles. Plant imprinting is assumed to occur in seeds, especially in the triploid endosperm, and is essential for seed development. Imprinting is thought to have evolved to control resource allocation in the developing seeds. In flowering plants, the endosperm is the only triploid tissue, containing two copies of the maternal genome and one copy of the paternal genome. It is therefore possible that imprinting arises due to the genomic imbalance inherent to a triploid tissue, whereby unequal allelic composition triggers the activation and/or silencing of parental alleles. In Arabidopsis thaliana, it is possible to generate triploid plants by crossing diploid and tetraploid parents. Reciprocal triploids in Arabidopsis have been shown to display differential plant and seed size, as well as disrupted imprinting in the endosperm. In order to test whether imprinting is solely triggered by genome dosage imbalance, and investigate genes possibly linked with the differential seed size observed in reciprocal triploids, we generated a whole-genome transcriptome dataset of reciprocal triploid hybrid late torpedo embryos to i) detect parental allelic contributions and ii) quantify gene expression differences.

From the aligned RNA-seq reads, and available genomic data for each of the parents of the cross, we imputed the genomes of each F2 individual (to allow genetic mapping of RNA abundance traits; briefly, genetic differences in aligned RNA-seq reads were used to impute each F2 genome). Our results show that heritable differences on gene expression can be detected using F2 populations (that is, single F2 plants), and shed light on the control of expression differences among strains of this reference plant.

PRJNA354802	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE 1 binds two distinct regulatory motifs and links plant water content with phosphate homeostasis in Arabidopsis thaliana	PHOSPHATE STARVATION RESPONSE1 (PHR1) is a central transcription factor (TF) of plant responses when phosphate (Pi) becomes limiting. We found that PHR1 binds 2,622 sites in the Arabidopsis genome, 664 located nearby Pi-starvation responsive genes. These sites are enriched in two motifs, P1BSI and P1BSII, displaying different binding affinities due to PHR1 acting either as dimer or monomer. A P1BSII- artificial promoter displays Pi starvation responsiveness, but at lower extent than its P1BSI counterpart, in line with the lower PHR1 binding affinity of P1BSII. Pi-starvation induced (PSI) targets with either P1BSI and P1BSII are enriched in different functional classes of genes, with P1BSI associated to core Pi starvation response genes. These binding sites also differ in their evolutionary constraints. In any case, their conservation was higher for binding sites prompting a transcriptional response by PHR1. Remarkably, binding sites nearby non-transcriptionally responsive genes were also conserved, indicative of functionality, e.g., as TF decoys. PSI PHR1 target genes are often also induced by drought and osmotic stress, compatible with the notion that plants reduce water content during Pi-starvation in a PHR1 dependent manner. This finding uncovers the physiological importance of the link between plant water content and Pi homeostasis. Less...

PRJNA358261	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	Plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) can release volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to promote plant growth and trigger induced systemic resistance (ISR) in plants. Importantly, the release of VOCs by some PGPR strains confers improved plant uptake of nutrient elements from the soils. However, the underlying mechanisms of VOCs-regulated nutrient acquisition remained elusive. In this study, VOCs were extracted and identified from Bacillus amyloliquefaciens (strain BF06) using gas chromatography–mass spectrometry (GC-MS). BF06 VOCs exposure significantly promoted the growth and photosynthesis of Arabidopsis plants. To explore how microbial VOCs stimulate growth in plants, gene expression profiles of Arabidopsis seedlings exposed to BF06 VOCs were examined using transcriptomic analyses. In screening differentially expressed genes (DEGs), most of up-regulated DEGs related to amino acid transport, iron (Fe) uptake and homeostasis, and sulfate transport. Furthermore, BF06 VOCs significantly enhanced Fe absorption in plants under Fe limited conditions. However, when the nitric oxide (NO) synthesis was inhibited, BF06 VOCs exposure could not substantially augment Fe acquisition in plants under alkaline stress, indicating that VOCs-mediated plant uptake of Fe was required for induction of root NO accumulation. In addition, BF06 VOCs exposure led to a marked increase of some genes encoding sulfate transporters, and further increased Se accumulation in plants. Intriguingly, BF06 VOCs exposure failed to increase Se uptake in sultr1;2 mutants, which may indicate that high-level transcription of these sulfate transporters induced by BF06 VOCs was essential for enhancing Se absorption by plants. Taken together, our results demonstrated the potential of VOCs released by this strain BF06 to increase Fe and Se uptake in plants. Less...

Here, we examined the ER- and rough ER- associated small RNAome, transcriptome and translatome. We found that nearly all cellular transcripts were present on membrane-bound polysomes (MBPs), and miRNAs and a small set of endogenous siRNAs were particularly enriched on MBPs. The MBP- enriched miRNAs and siRNAs associated with, and were recruited to membranes by, their effector protein ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1). AGO1 associated with ER in a partly RNA-independent manner. Reduced membrane association of 22-nt miRNAs, which trigger the biogenesis of phased, secondary siRNAs (phasiRNAs) from their target transcripts, was accompanied by decreased production or loss of phasing of phasiRNAs. The phasiRNA precursor transcripts, previously thought to be noncoding, were associated with MBPs in a manner that supported phasiRNA production. These findings point to the ER as a hub that hosts and organizes endogenous small RNAs in plants.

The Pol V largest subunit, NRPE1, has an extensive carboxyl-terminal domain (CTD) that is dispensable for catalytic activity in vitro, yet essential in vivo. A CTD subdomain, DeCL, named for its similarity to a chloroplast protein, DEFECTIVE CHLOROPLASTS AND LEAVES, is required for Pol V function at virtually all loci, similar to mutants defective for Pol V recruitment. Deletions removing three other CTD subdomains affect overlapping subsets of loci, similar to mutants lacking proteins that bind Pol V or its transcripts. A yeast two-hybrid screen for CTD-interactors identified the 3-prime -> 5-prime exoribonuclease, RRP6L1 as an interactor with the DeCL subdomain and the adjacent QS subdomain, named for its numerous glutamine-serine (QS) repeats. These RRP6L1-binding subdomains immediately follow the Argonaute-binding subdomain. Experimental evidence indicates that RRP6L1 trims the 3-prime ends of Pol V transcripts sliced by ARGONAUTE 4 (AGO4), suggesting a model whereby the adjacent CTD subdomains enable the spatial and temporal coordination of AGO4 and RRP6L1 RNA processing activities.

PRJEB18263	Allelic incompatibility based on natural epiallelesAn Arabidopsis natural epiallele maintained by a feed-forward silencing loop between histone and DNA	The extent of epigenetic variation is currently well documented, but the number of natural epialleles described so far remains very limited. Determining the relevance of epigenetic changes for natural variation is an important question of research that we investigate by isolating natural epialleles segregating in Arabidopsis recombinant populations. We previously described a genetic incompatibility among Arabidopsis strains based on the silencing of a gene involved in fitness. Here, we isolated a new epiallele resulting from the silencing of a transfer-RNA editing gene in an Arabidopsis accession from the Netherlands (Nok-1). Crosses with the reference accession Col-0 show a complete incompatibility between this epiallele and another locus localized on a different chromosome. We demonstrate that conversion of an unmethylated version of this allele occurs in hybrids, associated with modifications of small RNA populations. These epialleles can also spontaneously revert within the population. Furthermore, we bring evidence that neither METHYLTRANSFERASE 1, maintaining methylation at CGs, nor components of RNA-directed DNA methylation, are key factors for the transmission of the epiallele over generations. This depends only on the self-reinforcing loop between CHROMOMETHYLASE 3 and KRYPTONITE, involving DNA methylated in the CHG context and histone H3 lysine 9 methylation. Our findings reveal a predominant role of this loop in maintaining a natural epiallele. Less...

PRJNA360866	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Jasmonate Regulates Plant Responses to Reoxygenation through Activation of Antioxidant Synthesis	"Submergence induces hypoxia in plants; exposure to oxygen following submergence, termed reoxygenation, produces a burst of reactive oxygen species. The mechanisms of hypoxia sensing and signaling in plants have been well studied, but how plants respond to reoxygenation remains unclear. Here, we show that reoxygenation in Arabidopsis thaliana involves rapid accumulation of jasmonates (JAs) and increased transcript levels of JA biosynthesis genes. Application of exogenous methyl jasmonate improved tolerance to reoxygenation in wild-type Arabidopsis; also, mutants deficient in JA biosynthesis and signaling were very sensitive to reoxygenation. Moreover, overexpression of the transcription factor gene MYC2 enhanced tolerance to post-hypoxic stress and myc2 knockout mutants showed increased sensitivity to reoxygenation, indicating that MYC2 functions as a key regulator in the JA-mediated reoxygenation response. MYC2 transcriptionally activates members of the VITAMIN C DEFECTIVE (VTC) and GLUTATHIONE SYNTHETASE (GSH) gene families, which encode rate-limiting enzymes in the ascorbate and glutathione synthesis pathways. Overexpression of VTC1 and GSH1 in the myc2-2 mutant suppressed the post-hypoxic hypersensitive phenotype. The JA-inducible accumulation of antioxidants may alleviate oxidative damage caused by reoxygenation, improving plant survival after submergence. Taken together, our findings demonstrate that JA signaling interacts with the antioxidant pathway to regulate reoxygenation responses in Arabidopsis.

Here, we identify an Arabidopsis long-noncoding (lnc) RNA, designated elf18-induced long noncoding RNA 1 (ELENA1), as a factor enhancing resistance against Pseudomonas syringe pv. tomato DC3000. ELENA1 knock-down plants show a decreased expression of PR1 and the plants are susceptible to pathogens. By contrast, plants over-expressing ELENA1 show elevated Pathogenesis-Related gene 1 (PR1) expression after elf18 treatment and display pathogen resistance phenotype. RNA-seq analysis of ELENA1 overexpressing plants after elf18 treatment confirms increased expression of defense-related genes compared to WT. ELENA1 directly interacts with Mediator subunit 19a (MED19a) and affects enrichment of MED19a on PR1 promoter. These results show that ELENA1 is a novel lncRNA that regulates PR1 expression through MED19a. Our findings uncover an additional layer of complexity implicating lncRNA in the transcriptional regulation of plant innate immunity.

They produce multiple proteins from highly compact genomes and, similarly to viruses, must have evolved original strategies to optimize gene expression, although this aspect has been seldom investigated thus far. Here, we have established a high-resolution transcriptome/translatome map for the near-entirety of Arabidopsis thaliana transposons, using two distinct DNA methylation mutants in which transposon expression is broadly de-repressed. The value of this map to study potentially intact and transcriptionally active transposons in Arabidopsis thaliana is illustrated by our comprehensive analysis of the co-transcriptional and translational features of Ty1/Copia elements, a family of young and active retroelements in plant genomes, and how such features impact their biology. Genome-wide transcript profiling revealed a unique and widely conserved alternative splicing event coupled to premature termination that allows for the synthesis of a short subgenomic RNA solely dedicated to production of the Gag structural protein and preferentially associates with polysomes for efficient translation. Mutations engineered in a transgenic version of the Arabidopsis EVD Ty1/Copia element further show how alternative splicing is crucial for the appropriate coordination of full length and subgenomic RNA transcription. We propose that this hitherto undescribed genome expression strategy, conserved amongst plant Ty1/Copia elements, enables an excess of structural versus catalytic components, mandatory for mobilization.

Histone acetylation regulates gene expression of diverse biological processes, but little is known about its role in cuticular wax synthesis. Here we observed that mutation of Arabidopsis histone acetyltransferase GCN5 gene impaired stem cuticular wax accumulation. Furthermore, three target genes of GCN5 (CER3, CER26 and CER1-L1) were identified by RNA-Seq and ChIP assays. Consistently, H3K9/14 acetylation levels in promoter regions of CER3, CER26 and CER1-L1 were significantly decreased in gcn5 as compared to wild type. Notably, overexpression of CER3 in the gcn5 mutant restored the stem cuticular wax accumulation. Collectively, these data demonstrate that Arabidopsis GCN5 is involved in stem cuticular wax accumulation by modulating CER3 expression via H3K9/14 acetylation, which present evidence that histone acetylation plays an important role in cuticular wax biosynthesis Less...

However, little is known regarding their biological functions in plants. Here, we analyzed the phenotypes of mutants upon depleting different subfamilies of Arabidopsis SR proteins. We found that loss of the functions of SC35 and SC35-like (SCL) proteins cause pleiotropic changes in plant morphology and development, including serrated leaves, late flowering, shorter roots and abnormal silique phyllotaxy. Using RNA-seq, we found that SC35 and SCL proteins play roles in the pre-mRNA splicing. Motif analysis revealed that SC35 and SCL proteins preferentially bind to a specific RNA sequence containing the AGAAGA motif. In addition, the transcriptions of a subset of genes are affected by the deletion of SC35 and SCL proteins which interact with NRPB4, a specific subunit of RNA polymerase II. The splicing of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) intron1 and transcription of FLC were significantly regulated by SC35 and SCL proteins to control Arabidopsis flowering.

PRJNA362953	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Proximal methylation features associated with nonrandom changes in gene body methylation	"Gene body methylation at CG dinucleotides is a widely conserved feature of methylated genomes, but remains poorly understood. The A. thaliana strain Cvi has depleted methylation in gene bodies relative to the common reference strains Col and Ler. This naturally occurring hypomethylated strain offers the opportunity to improve understanding of the function and heritablity of genic CG methylation. We bisulfite-sequenced 10 recombinant inbred lines derived from a cross between Col and Cvi, as well as both parent lines, and examined the transmission of the different Col- and Cvi-derived gene body methylation states in these lines. We found that the majority of CG methylation polymorphisms were faithfully transmitted over nine generations according to the parental genotype in the RILs, with only 1-4% of CGs failing to maintain the parental methylation state. We found no evidence to suggest that these differences in gene body methylation led to changes in gene expression. However, we found that sites that fail to maintain the parental methylation state are nonrandom and are associated with intermediate levels of CG methylation and high methylation variability across many A. thaliana strains. These results provide new insights into the features determining the inheritance of gene body methylation and demonstrate that two different methylation equilibria can be maintained within single individuals.
Overall design: Examination of DNA methylation and gene expression in the wild-type A. thaliana strains Col and Cvi as well as in 10 Col/Cvi recombinant inbred lines (RIL) at the F9 generation. High-throughput whole-genome bisulfite-sequencing was used to examine DNA methylation and identify differences between RIL and parent lines, while poly-A-selected mRNA-seq was used to evaluate differences in gene expression. Bisulfite sequencing samples are designated BSseq_{strain}_N, where strain = col, cvi, or a number indicating the RIL line number (e.g. 8, 124 etc.). N = the replicate # (either 1 or 2).

PRJNA362994	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The Arabidopsis Cys2/His2 zinc-finger transcription factor ZAT18 is a positive regulator of plant tolerance to drought stress	"Purpose: We aimed to identify ZAT18 target genes and characterize functions of ZAT18 during plant drought tolerance
Methods: A total amount of 3 μg RNA was used for generation of sequencing libraries using NEBNext® Ultra™ RNA Library Prep Kit for Illumina® (NEB, USA) following manufacturer’s recommendations and index codes were added to attribute sequences to each sample. After cluster generation, the library preparations were sequenced on an Illumina Hiseq platform and 125 bp/150 bp paired-end reads were generated. Clean reads were obtained by removing low quality reads, reads containing adapter and ploy-N from raw data. At the same time, Q20, Q30 and GC content the clean data were calculated. Index of the Arabidopsis genome was built using Bowtie v2.2.3 and paired-end clean reads were aligned to the reference genome using TopHat v2.0.12. HTSeq v0.6.1 was used to count the reads numbers mapped to each gene. And then FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of transcript sequence per Millions base pairs sequenced) of each gene was calculated based on the length of the gene and reads count mapped to this gene. Differential expression analysis of drought stress versus control condition was performed using the DESeq R package (1.18.0).
Results:In total, eight samples with two biological replicates per genotype/treatment combination were used for RNA sequencing analysis. At least 2 G clean bases were generated for each sample. Comparative analysis revealed that 1777 genes were transcriptionally affected by AtZAT18 trasngene or drought treatment. The results showed that overexpression of AtZAT18 modulated expression level changes of 423 and 561genes under control and drought stress conditions, respectively. Drought stress treatment changed expression of 971 genes with 768 up-regulated and 203 down-regulated.
Overall design: In this study, wild type Arabidopsis and two lines of AtZAT18 transgenic plants were grown in moist soil for 7 days. Drought stress was imposed by withholding water for 10 days. The rosette leaves of control and drought treated Col-0 and AtZAT18 transgenic plants were then collected for RAN isolation.

PRJNA363056	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Tissue-Specific Transcriptomics Reveals Role of the Unfolded Protein Response in Maintaining Fertility upon Heat Stress in Arabidopsis	"Elevated temperature occurring at reproductive stage has great impact on gametophyte development and therefore ultimate fruit or seed set in plants, the underlying molecular mechanisms are less understood. We investigated the effect of elevated temperature stress on reproductive development in Arabidopsis with tissue-specific transcriptome profiling and observed distinct response patterns between vegetative and reproductive tissues. Heat stress exposure affected reproductive developmental programs including early phases of anther/ovule development and meiosis process, and genes participating in the unfolded protein response (UPR) were enriched among the heat up-regulated reproductive tissue-specific genes. We found that the bzip28bzip60 double mutant defective in UPR were sensitive to elevated temperature stress in terms of reduced silique length and fertility comparing to the wild-type plants. Comparison of heat responsiveness between the wild-type and bzip28zip60 plants identified 521 genes that were regulated by bZIP28 and bZIP60 upon heat stress at reproductive stage, most of which were non-canonical UPR genes. Further ChIP-Seq data revealed 133 direct targets of bZIP28 in Arabidopsis seedlings subjected to heat stress, of which 39 target genes were up-regulated by heat stress at reproductive stage. Our results provide novel insights into heat responsiveness in reproductive tissues and demonstrate the protective roles of UPR for maintaining fertility upon heat stress in plants.
Overall design: Flowering plants were treated at 37 0C for 3 hours, while the controls were taken at 22 0C, after which the early flower (EL), late flower (LF), and rosette leaf (RL) were collected in triplicate. cDNA library was constructed from the extracted total RNA and sequenced with Illumina HiSeq3000.

PRJNA363063	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-seq profiles of  Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type and trm4b-4	"Methylation of carbon 5 in cytosine (5-methylcytosine; m5C) is a well-characterized DNA modification, and is also predominantly reported in highly abundant noncoding RNAs, such as rRNA and tRNA, in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. However, the distribution and biological functions of m5C in plant mRNAs remain largely unknown. Here we develop an m5C RNA immunoprecipitation followed by deep sequencing approach (m5C-RIP-seq) to achieve transcriptome-wide profiling of RNA m5C in Arabidopsis thaliana. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) and dot blot analyses reveal a dynamic pattern of m5C mRNA modification in various tissues and at different developmental stages. m5C-RIP-seq analysis identifies 6,045 putative m5C peaks in 4,465 expressed genes in young seedlings. m5C is enriched in coding sequences with two peaks located immediately after start codons and before stop codons, and is associated with mRNAs with low translation activity. We further show that a RNA (cytosine-5)-methyltransferase, tRNA specific methyltransferase 4B (TRM4B), exhibits the m5C mRNA methyltransferase activity. Mutations in TRM4B display defects in root development and decreased m5C levels in root mRNA. Furthermore, TRM4B affects transcript levels of the genes involved in root development, which is positively correlated with their mRNA stability and m5C levels. Our results suggest that m5C in mRNA is a new epitranscriptome marker widely distributed in plant genes, and that regulation of this modification is an integral part of gene regulatory networks underlying plant development.

PRJNA368916	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)An RNA-seq dataset for studies of gene expression variation in the MAGIC line resource of Arabidopsis thaliana	"To understand the population genetics of structural variants (SVs), and their effects on phenotypes, we developed an approach to mapping SVs, particularly transpositions, segregating in a sequenced population, and which avoids calling SVs directly. The evidence for a potential SV at a locus is indicated by variation in the counts of short-reads that map anomalously to the locus. These SV traits are treated as quantitative traits and mapped genetically, analogously to a gene expression study. Association between an SV trait at one locus and genotypes at a distant locus indicate the origin and target of a transposition. Using ultra-low-coverage (0.3x) population sequence data from 488 recombinant inbred Arabidopsis genomes, we identified 6,502 segregating SVs. Remarkably, 25% of these were transpositions. Whilst many SVs cannot be delineated precisely, PCR validated 83% of 44 predicted transposition breakpoints. We show that specific SVs may be causative for quantitative trait loci for germination, fungal disease resistance and other phenotypes. Further we show that the phenotypic heritability attributable to sequence anomalies differs from, and in the case of time to germination and bolting, exceeds that due to standard genetic variation. Gene expression within SVs is also more likely to be silenced or dysregulated, as inferred from RNA-seq data collected from a subset of just over 200 of the MAGIC lines. This approach is generally applicable to large populations sequenced at low-coverage, and complements the prevalent strategy of SV discovery in fewer individuals sequenced at high coverage.
Overall design: 209 samples consisting of different inbred lines from the Multiparent Advance Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population in the reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. For each sample, RNA was collected from the aerial shoot at the 4th true leaf stage, and Illumina mRNA-seq libraries were constructed (a single library was constructed with each line; that is, each MAGIC line is represented by one biological replicate). Using these libraries, which were non-stranded, paired-end 100 bp RNA-seq Illumina reads were generated for each sample, and used to quantify gene expresison in each MAGIC line. The resulting expression phenotypes are suitable for describing the impacts of genetic variation in the MAGIC line founders on the control of gene expression. Less..."

PRJDB5192	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)The gene-body chromatin modifications dynamics mediates epigenome differentiation in Arabidopsis	Constitutively silent heterochromatin is marked by methylation of lysine 9 on histone H3 (H3K9me). A puzzling feature of H3K9me is that this modification generally localizes not only in promoters but also in internal regions (bodies) of silent transcription units. Despite its prevalence, biological significance of gene-body H3K9me remains enigmatic. Here we show that H3K9me-directed removal of H3K4 monomethylation (H3K4me1) in the gene-bodies mediates transcriptional silencing. Mutations in an Arabidopsis H3K9 demethylase gene IBM1 induce ectopic H3K9me2 accumulation in gene-bodies, which is associated with severe developmental defects. Through suppressor screening of the ibm1- induced developmental defects, we identified LDL2 gene, which encodes a homolog of conserved H3K4 demethylases. The ldl2 mutation suppressed the developmental defects, but it did not suppress the ibm1-induced ectopic H3K9me2. The ectopic H3K9m2 directed reduced body H3K4me1 and transcriptional repression, which depend on the LDL2 function. Furthermore, mutations of H3K9 methylases induced drastic increases in H3K4me1 in the bodies of diverse transposable elements. Our results uncovered an unexpected role of gene-body H3K9me2/H3K4me1 dynamics as a mediator of heterochromatin silencing and epigenome differentiation. Less...

PRJNA369530	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide chromatin mapping with size resolution reveals a dynamic sub-nucleosomal landscape in Arabidopsis	"Background:
Analysis of the effect that chromatin structure has on the expression patterns of eukaryotic genes has recently expanded knowledge of the complex influence genome accessibility has on genome function. Interlaced with regular nucleosomal patterning are other mobile and labile sub-nucleosomal-sized protein structures bound to the genome such as transcription factors (TF), initiation complexes, and modified nucleosomes.
Results:
We present chromatin structure maps of the A. thaliana Col-0 wild-type (in vitro cell culture) combining differential micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion and analysis by paired-end next-generation sequencing with RNASeq data to provide insight into the sensitive genomic regions and variable DNA-bound particle size related to transcriptional activity. The landscape of sub-nucleosomal sized particles (subNSPs) has been investigated, revealing the DNA-binding complex positioning genome-wide. We observe the dynamic changes in the distribution of these complexes surrounding genomic features, particularly at transcription start sites (TSS). Differential digestion reveals the presence of MNase-sensitive smaller particles and a labile -1 nucleosome upstream of the TSS of active genes. These changes correlate with gene expression differences resulting from different environmental conditions of light- or dark growth both globally and locally, and a complex profile of bound particles is directly visualised.
Conclusions:
Analysis of the A. thaliana genome reveals that resolution of chromatin particle size by differential MNase digestion allows detection of the sensitive features in chromatin structure that have hereto been obfuscated. The concomitant analysis of transcript levels reveals the impact of transient extrinsic factors in modifying the sub- nucleosomal landscape in association with transcriptional changes, giving insight into the binding of transcription-associated factors.

We epitope tagged four B-ARRs (1, 10, 12, and 14) using recombineering techniques and profiled TF binding sites using chromatin immunoprecipitation sequencing (ChIP-seq). The resulting cytokinin transcriptional response network allowed construction of the first cytokinin TF network, identification of numerous direct downstream targets along with the B-ARR-6BA motif and elucidation of one mechanism of activation of WUSCHEL, which requires a high concentration of cytokinin in shoot apical meristem for TF binding.

The expression and genomic protein localization of B-ARRs overlap extensively, demonstrating numerous common targets among the B-ARRs. The negative regulators of cytokinin signaling, the type-A ARRs (A-ARRs), are the top ranked targets of B-ARRs.

The F2 generation loses much of the yield advantage and the plants have heterogeneous phenotypes. We generated pure breeding Hybrid Mimic lines by recurrent selection and also selected a pure breeding Small phenotype line. The Hybrid Mimics are almost completely homozygous with chromosome segments from each parent. Four particular chromosomal segments from C24 and eight from Ler were present in all of the Hybrid Mimic lines whereas in the F6 Small phenotype line the 12 segments were each derived from the alternative parent. Loci critical for promoting hybrid vigor may be contained in each of these 12 conserved segments. We have identified genes with similar altered expression in Hybrid Mimics and F1 plants but not in the Small phenotype line. These genes may be critical for the generation of hybrid vigour. Analysis of transcriptomes indicated that increased expression of the transcription factor PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR (PIF4) may contribute to hybrid vigor by targeting the auxin biosynthesis gene YUCCA8 and the auxin signalling gene IAA29. A number of auxin responsive genes promoting leaf growth were upregulated in the F1 hybrids and Hybrid Mimics suggesting increased auxin biosynthesis and signaling contribute to the hybrid phenotype. The Hybrid Mimic seeds had earlier germination as did the seeds of the F1 hybrids indicating co-segregation of the genes for rosette size and the germination trait. Early germination may be an indicator of vigorous hybrids.

However, little is known regarding the function and working mechanism of the CLEs in the anther. Here, using RNA in situ hybridization analyses, we identified 7 CLE genes that are specifically expressed in the tapetum and microsporocytes in the anther, and the dominant-negative mutant plants of each of these genes exhibited significantly reduced anther size, pollen number, and abnormal pollen wall formation. Further transcriptomic and proteomic studies on cle19, DN-CLE19, and CLE19-OX mutant lines revealed that CLE19 affected the expression of more than 1,000 genes at the RNA level and 595 at the protein level, including genes involved in pollen coat and pollen exine formation, lipid metabolism, pollen germination, and hormone metabolism processes. Phenotypic analyses of mutants of the CLE19 downstream genes GRP20, ACOS5 and MEE48 revealed that the formation of pollen exine was affected in these mutants, confirming that these genes function downstream of CLE19 in the regulation of pollen wall formation.

PRJNA373835	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Dynamic DNA methylation reconfiguration during seed development and germination (RNA-seq)	"The life cycle of flowering plants ends and begins with seeds. Unlike animals, plants can pause their life cycle as dormant seeds during this transition. DNA methylation is involved in the regulation of gene expression and genome integrity. Reprogramming erases and re-establishes DNA methylation during development in animals. Knowledge of reprogramming or reconfiguration in plants has been limited to pollen and the central cell. To better understand epigenetic reconfiguration in the embryo, which forms the plant body, we compared dry and germinating seed time-series methylomes to publicly available seed development methylomes. Time-series whole genome bisulfite sequencing (WGBS) revealed extensive gain of CHH methylation during seed development and drastic loss of CHH methylation during germination. These dynamic changes in methylation mainly occur within transposable elements. Active DNA methylation during embryogenesis depends on both RNA-directed DNA methylation and heterochromatin formation pathways whereas global demethylation during germination occurs in a passive manner. However, an active DNA demethylation pathway is initiated during late embryogenesis, which contributes to the endosperm specific methylation patterns.This study provides new insights into dynamic DNA methylation reprogramming events during seed development and germination and suggests possible mechanisms of regulation. The observed sequential methylation/demethylation cycle suggests an important role of DNA methylation in seed dormancy.

Here, we report the parallel employment of RNA sequencingshort-read RNA sequencing, single molecule long-read sequencing and proteomic identification to unravel AS isoforms and novel unannotated proteins in response to abscisic acid (ABA) treatment. Combining the data of the two sequencing methods, approximately 83.4% of intron-containing genes were alternatively spliced. Two newly defined AS types, which are referred to as alternative first exon (AFE) and alternative last exon (ALE), were more abundant than intron retention (IR). However, by contrast to AS events detected under normal conditions, ABA-regulateddifferentially expressed AS isoforms were more likely to be translated. ABA extensively regulates affects the AS pattern by increasing the number of non-conventional splicing sites.

PRJNA374742	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide analysis of transcription, H2A.Z, nucleosomes and HSF1 dynamics in response to temperature increase in Arabidopsis thaliana [RNA-Seq II]	"Plants are sessile organisms and therefore must sense and respond to changes of their surrounding conditions such as ambient temperature, which vary diurnally and seasonally. It is not yet clear how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development. We have previously shown that H2A.Z-nucleosomes are evicted in response to warmer temperatures. It is not clear however, whether the link between transcriptional responsiveness and changes in H2A.Z binding in context of temperature shifts is a global trend that can be seen throughout the genome, or the phenomenon is specific to a specialised set of temperature-responsive genes. In addition to the role of H2A.Z-nucleosome dynamics in the transcriptional response to temperature, it was shown that genes strongly misregulated in the h2a.z mutant are enriched for gene categories involved in response to multiple environmental cues. This suggests that H2A.Z could be implicated in the transcriptional response to various environmental inputs, raising the question: What brings the specificity of H2A.Z dynamics in response to temperature? To address this question we have profiled H2A.Z-nucleosome occupancy genome wide (using ChIP-seq) during a time course after temperature variation and compared its dynamics to transcriptional changes. We identified a fast, targeted and transient eviction of H2A.Z associated with transcriptional activation in response to temperature for a few hundreds genes. This eviction is associated with a reduction of the stability of the nucleosome. Moreover the genes with a fast H2A.Z eviction were strongly enriched in heat shock elements in their promoter and we observed a strong association between HSF1 binding and H2AZ eviction at warm temperature. These results highlight the importance of the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin to allow a controlled and dynamics response to temperature.

PRJNA375085	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genetic Dissection of the Spaceflight Transcriptome Responses in Plants: are some responses unnecessary?	"Experimentation on the International Space Station has reached the stage where repeated and nuanced transcriptome studies are beginning to illuminate the structural and metabolic differences between plants grown in space compared to plants on the Earth. Genes that are important in setting up the spaceflight responses are being identified; their role in spaceflight physiological adaptation are increasingly understood, and the fact that different genotypes adapt differently is recognized. However, the basic question of whether these spaceflight responses are required for survival has yet to be posed, and the fundamental notion that spaceflight responses may be non-adaptive has yet to be explored. Therefore the experiments presented here were designed to ask if portions of the plant spaceflight response can be genetically removed without causing loss of spaceflight survival and without causing increased stress responses. The CARA experiment compared the spaceflight transcriptome responses of two Arabidopsis ecotypes, Col-0 and WS, as well as that of a PhyD mutant of Col-0. When grown with the ambient light of the ISS, phyD displayed a significantly reduced spaceflight transcriptome response compared to Col-0, suggesting that altering the activity of a single gene can actually improve spaceflight adaptation by reducing the transcriptome cost of physiological adaptation. The WS genotype showed and even simpler spaceflight transcriptome response in the ambient light of the ISS, more broadly indicating that the plant genotype can be manipulated to reduce the transcriptome cost of plant physiological adaptation to spaceflight and suggesting that genetic manipulation might further reduce, or perhaps eliminate the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation. When plants were germinated and then left in the dark on the ISS, the WS genotype actually mounted a larger transcriptome response than Col-0, suggesting that the in-space light environment affects physiological adaptation, which further implies that manipulating the local habitat can also substantially impact the metabolic cost of spaceflight adaptation.
Overall design: CARA Seed Lines and Planting:   Three seed lines Wild-Type Wassilewskija (Ws), Columbia-0 (Col-0) and Col-0 PhyD (phyD) Mutants were tested for viability, sterility and ability to maintain dormancy before the launch. Tested batches of seeds were planted on phytagel plates as one genotype per plate for gene expression analysis in replicates of three. One set was planted for the flight and one for ground control. The plates were wrapped such that every surface of the plate was covered by two layers of Duvetyn Black-Out cloth (Seattle Fabrics) (Sng et al, 2014). The plates were stored 4° C until launch, and was then launched in a cold-stow bag to maintain the plates at 4° C until integration and activation on the ISS.   On Orbit Operations and harvest:   The dormant plates were activated on station by removing the Black-Out cloth wrapping 12 days after launch. The plates were then placed on a fabric that was mounted in the US Laboratory module on the wall adjoining the MELFI freezer and secured using Velcro. The plants were allowed to grow on orbit for 11 days; some in the ambient light of ISS and some in the dark. The dark-grown plates were first activated by exposing the seeds to light for 4 hours, and then re-wrapped in Black-Out cloth for the duration of the growth period. A corresponding set of seedlings were grown as ground control in KSC.   At 11 days, seedlings were photographed, harvested into KFT containing RNAlater solutions and returned for post-flight analysis. All plates were harvested into KFTs with their counterpart (e.g. Light 1 was harvested with Dark 1). Once the plants were placed in the KFTs, the KFT was actuated with RNAlater to preserve the sample. At 24 hours post-harvest, KFTs were then transferred to MELFI, the -32°C freezer. Following SpaceX-3 splashdown in the Pacific Ocean, the KFTs transferred to the Cold Stowage charter plane at the Long Beach Airport, placed into an insulated shipper with dry ice, and flown to Johnson Space Center (JSC). The KFTs were then transferred via FedEx ground to the Kennedy Space Center. The KFTs were removed from dry ice and transferred to a -80°C freezer on May 22, 2014. The PIs retrieved the plant samples from the KFTs on May 29, 2014 and transferred the samples back to the University of Florida.  The harvested material was used to compare the transcriptomes of each genotype. The patterns of gene expression was compared among genotypes within a treatment (spaceflight or unit gravity) and between treatments (spaceflight versus ground control) for each genotype. Less..."

PRJNA375099	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Ascorbate concentration in Arabidopsis is controlled at the gene expression level mainly by GDP galactose phosphorylase	"We explore where transcriptional regulation of ascorbate concentration lies in plants. Is it in biosynthesis, recycling, regulation or consumption? Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown under controlled environment at four photon flux density levels (PFD). Rosettes from plants were harvested at the four PFD levels and over a diurnal cycle and after a step change in PFD and analysed for ascorbate concentration and transcript levels measured by RNAseq. Ascorbate concentrations and expression of genes in the L-galactose ascorbate biosynthesis, recycling, consumption pathways and regulation are presented to provide a full analysis of the control of ascorbate by environmentally modulated gene expression. Ascorbate concentration responded to PFD levels but not to time of day and showed only a small response to change of PFD after 2 days. Of the L-galactose pathway genes, only GDP galactose phosphorylase (GGP) showed a significant response in to different PFDs, time of day and to change in PFD.  Other genes also showed limited responses. This study compares gene expression of a range of ascorbate related genes to changes in environment in a unified way and supports the concept that GGP is the key regulatory gene in ascorbate biosynthesis and that post transcriptional regulation is also important.
Overall design: Arabidopsis were grown in controlled envrionment and ascorbate and gene expression measured at different light intensities, time of day and change in light intensity. 24 samples are analysed with two replicates per treatment. Less..."

PRJEB15202	Arabidopsis proteins with a transposon-related domain act in gene silencing	Transposable elements are prevalent in most eukaryotes, and host genomes have devised silencing strategies to rein in transposable element activity. One of these, transcriptional silencing, is generally associated with DNA methylation and short interfering RNAs. Here we show that the Arabidopsis genes MAIL1 and MAIN define an alternative silencing pathway independent of DNA methylation and short interfering RNAs. Mutants for MAIL1 or MAIN exhibit release of silencing and appear to show impaired condensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin. Phylogenetic analysis suggests not only that MAIL1 and MAIN encode a retrotransposon-related Plant Mobile Domain, but also that host Plant Mobile Domains were captured by DNA transposons during plant evolution. Our results reveal a role for Arabidopsis proteins with a transposon-related domain in gene silencing. Less...

"The development of Col-0 and WS plants on orbit differs from that on the ground as demonstrated by the comparison of the gene expression profiles between 4 days old to 8 days old plant in the two environments. The Col-0 plants used different genes reflecting different physiological processes than WS plants, suggesting the role of the genetic background in the developmental decisions. The 4 days old Col-0 plant in orbit showed deficit in wax and suberin production relatively to the 8 days old plants, the difference unregistered on the ground. There was more dramatic difference in the overexpression of the root system development and anatomical structure development genes in 8 days old plants than in 4 days old plant in both genotypes on the ground than in flight, implying smaller root developmental gap between 4 days and 8 days old roots in orbit. The WS plant uniquely showed overexpression of the photosynthesis related genes in the 4 days old roots relative to 8 days old root in the spaceflight environment but not on the ground.  The seeds germinated in the novel growth environment of ISS implemented different developmental strategies as captured by the genes expression patterns, than seeds developing on the ground.

Using strand-specific short read sequencing we show that knockdown of XRN3 leads to an altered expression of hundreds of genes and the accumulation of uncapped and polyadenylated read-through transcripts generated by inefficiently terminated Pol II. Our data support the notion that XRN3-mediated changes in the expression of a subset of genes are caused by upstream read-through transcription and these effects are enhanced by RNA-mRNA chimeras generated in xrn3 plants. In turn, read-through transcripts that are antisense to downstream genes may trigger production of siRNA. Our results highlight the importance of XRN3 exoribonuclease in Pol II transcription termination in plants and show that disturbance in this process may significantly alter gene expression.

PRJNA377881	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)HOP family plays a major role in long term acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis affecting the HSR and protein QC	"HOP is a family of cytosolic cochaperones whose molecular role in thermotolerance was quite unknown in eukaryotes and unexplored in plants. In this article, we describe that the three members of the HOP family display a different induction pattern under heat, being HOP3 highly regulated during the challenge and the attenuation period. Despite this tight HOP3 regulation, the analysis of the hop1 hop2 hop3 triple mutant demonstrates that the three AtHOP proteins act redundantly to promote long acquired thermotolerance in Arabidopsis. AtHOPs interact very strongly with HSP90 and part of the bulk of HOP shuttles from the cytoplasm to cytoplasmic foci and to the nucleus in response to heat. Consistent with this latter location, and with the formation of a HOP complex with HsfA1, RNAseq analyses demonstrate that HSR is altered in the hop1 hop2 hop3 triple mutant during the heat stress.In addition, this mutant displays an unusual high accumulation of insoluble and ubiquitinated proteins under heat. These data reveal that HOPs play a main role in two different aspects of the response to heat: the maintenance of protein homeostasis and the proper establishment of the HSR, affecting the plant capacity to acclimate to heat stress for long periods.

PRJNA377889	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis ZED1-related kinases mediate temperature-sensitive intersection of immune response and growth homeostasis	"The rationale: Activation of the immune response antagonizes plant growth and development in absence of pathogen, and such autoimmune phenotype is often suppressed by the elevation of ambient temperature. However, the molecular regulation of ambient temperature-sensitive intersection of immune response and growth is largely elusive.
Methods: A genetic screen identified an Arabidopsis mutant, zed1-D, by its high temperature-dependent growth retardation. A combination of molecular, cytological and genetic approaches was used to investigate the molecular basis behind the temperature-sensitive growth and immune response in zed1-D.
Key results: A dominant mutation in HOPZ-ETI-DEFICIENT 1 (ZED1) is responsible for a high temperature-dependent autoimmunity and growth retardation in the zed1-D. The autoimmune phenotype in the zed1-D is dependent on the HOPZ-ACTIVATED RESISTANCE 1 (ZAR1). ZED1 and some ZED1-related kinases (ZRKs) are induced by elevated temperature and function cooperatively to suppress the immune response by modulating the transcription of SUPPRESSOR OF NPR1-1 CONSTITUTIVE 1 (SNC1) in absence of pathogen.
Main conclusion: Our data reveal a previously unidentified role of ZRKs in ambient temperature-sensitive immune response in absence of pathogen, and thus disclose a possible molecular mechanism underlying temperature-mediated intersection of immune response and growth in plants.

At the core of RNAi are small RNAs (sRNAs) and effector Argonaute proteins. Arabidopsis AGO1 is known to bind microRNAs (miRNAs) and post-transcriptionally repress target genes via mRNA cleavage and/or translational inhibition in the cytoplasm. Here, we report that AGO1 binds to the chromatin of transcriptionally active genes and promotes their transcription. We show that sRNAs and SWI/SNF are required for AGO1 binding to chromatin and its function in promoting gene transcription. Moreover, we show that various stimuli including plant hormones and stresses specifically trigger AGO1 binding to the stimulus-responsive genes. Finally, we show that AGO1 facilitates the induction of genes in the jasmonate (JA) signaling pathways and the activation of JA responses. Our findings reveal an unsuspected role for AGO1 in facilitating gene transcription in response to plant hormones and stresses.
Overall design: We conducted AGO1 ChIP-seq with Arabidopsis wild-type (WT, Col-0) and ago1-36 seedlings under normal growth condition or treatment with MeJA, BTH, IAA, Flg22 or cold; RNA-seq with WT and ago1-36 seedlings under normal or MeJA treatment condition; Pol II, Pol II Ser2 and Pol II Ser5 ChIP-seq with WT and ago1-36; GRO-seq with WT and ago1-36; and small RNA-seq of nuclear AGO1-associated small RNAs purified from WT and coi1 under normal or MeJA treatment condition.

PRJNA378644	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Chloroplast signalling gates thermotolerance in Arabidopsis	"Temperature has a major role in plant growth and survival, for example wheat yields decrease by about 6% for every 1°C rise in global temperature [1]. High temperatures induce the expression of protective chaperones and modulate growth responses. Key players in the heat protection response are transcription factors of the HEAT SHOCK FACTOR A1 (HSFA1) family [2]. However the pathways that activate the HSFA1 class TFs, and how these perceive temperature and integrate it with other environmental signals are not clear. Plants are exposed to considerable diurnal temperature variation, and have evolved pathways to anticipate likely future conditions. For example, the cold response pathway is gated by the circadian clock, enabling the degree of responsiveness to cold to be controlled in the context of the environment [3, 4] and genes promoting elongation growth and flowering in response to warm temperature are induced during the night via thermosensory phytochromes [5 ,6]. It is not known in Arabidopsis if the warm temperature protective pathways are gated. In this study we find that there is strong diurnal variation in the heat stress response of Arabidopsis, and we show that this correlates with the expression of HSP70 in the day night cycle. The dark to light transition is in fact sufficient to robustly induce expression of warm temperature protective genes such as HSP70. A forward genetic screen with a HSP70-Luciferase reporter line revealed genes necessary for controlling this process and identified a central role for chloroplast signalling in the warm temperature response that accounts for diurnal variation in thermotolerance.

PRJEB19862	Auxin and ETT-partner complexesAuxin orchestrates gene transcription through dynamic modulation of ETT-partner complexes	The phytohormone auxin governs crucial developmental decisions throughout the entire plant life cycle. The effectors of auxin nuclear signalling are the Auxin Responsive Factors (ARFs), whose activity is modulated by the Aux/IAA repressors to ensure transcriptional regulation upon increase of auxin cellular concentration. ARF3/ETTIN (ETT), known for decades for its role during reproductive structure development, is a conserved non-canonical ARF that adopts an alternate auxin sensing method to translate cellular auxin levels into a precise transcriptional outcome. However, direct confirmation of the biological significance for such auxin dependent modulation of ETT activity has not been elucidated yet. Here, through genome-wide approaches combined with expression analyses and supported by genetic evidence, we describe how ETT through its auxin-sensing property is necessary to orchestrate auxin-driven developmental responses in the Arabidopsisshoot. Moreover, we elucidate how precise ETT-dependent transcriptional regulation involves ETT protein partners, which offer an anchor point for target sequences devoid of ETT binding sites. Our work provides a detailed understanding of a biological mechanism that facilitates, through a simple ETT-partner module, multiple levels of transcriptional and developmental diversity Less...

RNA was collected at the 4th true leaf stage, and RNA-seq data was generated using the Illumina method. The MAGIC lines included are largely a subset of lines for which comparable RNA-seq data was collected at a constant 20˚C (allowing the same genotypes to be compared at 20˚C and after the high temperature shift at approximately the same developmental stage and under otherwise the same growth conditions). The read data for the analogous low temperature study can be found under GEO submission GSE94107.
Overall design: In total 103 RNA-seq samples from different inbred lines from the Multiparent Advance Generation InterCross (MAGIC) population in the reference plant, Arabidopsis thaliana, were generated. For each sample, RNA was collected from the aerial shoot from 20 seedlings at the 4th true leaf stage (after a temperature shift from 20˚C to 30˚C), and Illumina mRNA-seq libraries were constructed (a single library was constructed with each line; that is, each MAGIC line is represented by one biological replicate). Using these libraries, which were non-stranded, paired-end 100 bp RNA-seq Illumina reads were generated for each sample, and used to quantify gene expresison in each MAGIC line. The resulting expression phenotypes are suitable for describing the impacts of segregating genetic variation on the control of gene expression. Less..."

Overall design: N6-adenosine methylation (m6A) of mRNA is an essential process in most Eukaryotes, but its role and the status of factors accompanying this modification are still poorly understood. Using combined methods of genetics, proteomics and RNA biochemistry, we identify a core set of mRNA m6A writer proteins in Arabidopsis thaliana. The components required for m6A in Arabidopsis include MTA, MTB, FIP37, VIRILIZER and the E3 ubiquitin ligase HAKAI. Downregulation of these proteins leads to reduced m6A levels and shared pleiotropic phenotypes, which include aberrant vascular formation in the root, indicating that correct m6A methylation plays a role in developmental decisions during pattern formation. The conservation of these proteins amongst Eukaryotes and the demonstration of a role in writing m6A for the E3 ubiquitin ligase HAKAI is likely to be of considerable relevance beyond the plant sciences.

PRJNA380922	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Response of Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings to acyl-CoAs	"Floodings already have a nearly 60% share in the worldwide damage to crops provoked by natural disasters. Climate change will cause plants to be even more frequently exposed to oxygen limiting conditions (hypoxia) in the near future due to heavy precipitation and concomitant waterlogging or flooding events in large areas of the world. Although the homeostatic regulation of adaptive responses to low oxygen stress in plants is well described, it remained unknown by which initial trigger the molecular response to low-oxygen stress is activated. Here, we show that a hypoxia-induced decline of the ATP level of the cell reduces LONG-CHAIN ACYL-COA SYNTHETASE (LACS) activity, which leads to a shift in the composition of the acyl-CoA pool. High oleoyl-CoA levels release the transcription factor RELATED TO APETALA 2.12 (RAP2.12) from its interaction partner ACYL-COA BINDING PROTEIN (ACBP) at the plasma membrane to induce low oxygen-specific gene expression. We show that different acyl-CoAs provoke unique molecular responses revealing a novel role as cellular signalling component also in plants. In terms of hypoxia signalling, dynamic acyl-CoA levels integrate the cellular energy status into the oxygen signalling cascade with ACBP and RAP2.12 being the central hub. The conserved nature of the ACBP:RAP2.12 module in crops and the novel mechanistic understanding of how low-oxygen stress responses are initiated by oleoyl-CoA in plants provide useful leads for enhancing future food security.

PRJNA381039	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The histone H3 variant H3.3 regulates gene body DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana [RNA-Seq]	"Gene bodies of vertebrates and flowering plants are occupied by histone variant H3.3 and DNA methylation. The origin and significance of these profiles remain largely unknown. The profiles of enrichments in DNA methylation and H3.3 over gene bodies are correlated and both depend similarly on gene transcription levels. This suggests a mechanistic link between H3.3 and gene body methylation. We engineered H3.3 knockdown in Arabidopsis and observed transcription reduction that predominantly affected genes responsive to environmental cues. When H3.3 levels were reduced, gene bodies showed a loss of DNA methylation correlated with transcription levels. To study the origin of changes in DNA methylation profiles when H3.3 levels are reduced, we examined genome wide distributions of several histone H3 marks, H2A.Z, linker histone H1 and nucleosome densities. We observed that in absence of H3.3, H1 distribution increased in gene bodies. This depends on levels of gene transcription. We propose that H3.3 prevents recruitment of H1, which in turn promotes chromatin folding and antagonizes access to DNA methyltransferases responsible for gene body methylation. Thus, gene body methylation is likely shaped by H3.3 dynamics in relation with transcriptional activity.

PRJNA381131	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Auxin regulates functional gene groups in a fold-specific manner in Arabidopsis root	"Auxin plays a pivotal role in virtually every aspect of plant morphogenesis. It simultaneously orchestrates a wide variety of processes, including cell wall biogenesis, transition through the cell cycle, and metabolism of a wide range of chemical substances, among others. The coordination principles for such complex regulation in a cell at a system level are poorly understood.
Here, we apply a whole-genome approach to estimate the coherence of the auxin-regulated transcriptional response in gene groups, united by a certain biological process, molecular function or cell component, based on the fold change of the expression level.
The corresponding analysis of RNA-Seq data for Arabidopsis roots treated with auxin for 6 h revealed that the intervals for the fold change of gene expression levels are quite narrow for many functional gene groups. The fold-specific manner of auxin response in most of these groups was confirmed using independent microarray data. To predict the mechanisms underlying such a coordinated expression, we performed motif enrichment analysis, which revealed TBX1-3, SBX, REG and TCP/site 2 as the candidates associated with fold-specific responses to auxin.

PRJNA79809	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)GENE-counter: a computational and statistical pipeline for assessing RNA-Seq data for genome-wide expression differences	RNA-Sequencing is a transformative method that captures the quantitative dynamics of a transcriptome with exquisite sensitivity and single-base resolution. There are, however, few computational pipelines for RNA-Seq with statistical tests that evince sufficient robustness and power as demanded by the difficult combination of small sample sizes and high variability in sequence read counts. To this end, we developed GENE-counter, a complete software pipeline for analyzing RNA-Seq data for genome-wide expression differences between replicated treatment groups. One important component of GENE-counter is a statistical test based on the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution for identifying differentially expressed genome features. We used GENE-counter to analyze RNA-Seq data derived from Arabidopsis thaliana infected with a strain of defense-eliciting bacteria. We identified 308 genes that were differentially induced. Using alternative methods, we provided support for the induced expression and biological relevance of a substantial proportion of the genes. These results suggest the NBP parameterization of the negative binomial distribution is well suited for explaining RNA-Seq data and the statistical test makes GENE-counter a powerful pipeline for studying genome-wide expression changes.

PRJEB5030	Bundle sheath role in Arabidopsis thaliana investigated by ribosomal profilingTranscript residency on ribosomes reveals a key role for the Arabidopsis thaliana bundle sheath in sulphur and glucosinolate metabolism.	Leaves of angiosperms are made up of multiple distinct cell types. While the function of mesophyll cells, guard cells, phloem companion cells and sieve elements are clearly described, this is not the case for the bundle sheath (BS).  To provide insight into the role of the BS in the C3 species Arabidopsis thaliana, we labelled ribosomes in this cell type with a FLAG tag.  We then used immunocapture to isolate these ribosomes followed by sequencing of resident mRNAs.  This showed that 5% of genes showed specific splice forms in the BS, and that 15% of genes were preferentially expressed in these cells. The BS translatome strongly implicates the BS in specific roles in sulphur transport and metabolism, glucosinolate biosynthesis and trehalose metabolism.  Much of the C4 cycle is differentially expressed between the C3 BS and the rest of the leaf.  Furthermore, the global patterns of transcript residency on BS ribosomes overlap to a greater extent with cells of the root pericycle than any other cell type.  This analysis provides the first insight into the molecular function of this cell type in C3 species, and also indicates that at least some of the characteristics of BS cells in C4 plants are likely ancestral traits unrelated to the C4 photosynthesis.

Despite extensive studies of specific genes that regulate this process, the global changes in transcript expression profiles at the point when a vegetative meristem transitions into an inflorescence have not been described. In this study we analyzed gene expression during Arabidopsis thaliana meristem development from day 7 to 16 after germination in one-day increments. The dynamics of the expression of the main flowering regulators were consistent with previous reports: notably, the expression of FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC) decreased over the course of the time series while expression of LEAFY (LFY) increased. This analysis revealed a developmental time point between 10 and 12 days after germination where FLC expression had decreased but LFY expression had not yet increased, which was characterized by a peak in the number of differentially expressed genes. GO enrichment analysis of these genes identified an overrepresentation of genes related to the cell cycle, suggesting that during transition to the flowering stage a change in dynamics of cell division takes place. In particular, we hypothesize that a subset of the meristematic cells experiences a forced exit from G0 at day 10. Finally, we observed an acceleration of the cell cycle at day 11, which may be linked to meristem reorganization preceding activation of LFY. Less...

These maturing cells transition from a proliferative state to a terminal state through the process of differentiation. In the Arabidopsis thaliana root the transcription factors SCARECROW and SHORTROOT regulate specification of the bi-potent stem cell that gives rise to the cortical and endodermal progenitors. Subsequent progenitor proliferation and differentiation generates mature endodermis, marked by the Casparian Strip: a cell wall modification that prevents ion diffusion into and out of the vasculature. We identified a transcription factor, MYB36 that regulates the transition from proliferation to differentiation in the endodermis. We show that SCARECROW directly activates MYB36 expression, which in turn directly regulates essential Casparian Strip formation genes. In addition, MYB36 represses extra divisions within the endodermis. Our results demonstrate that MYB36 is a critical positive regulator of differentiation and negative regulator of cell proliferation.

PRJEB9919	Epigenome confrontation triggers immediate reprogramming of DNA methylation and transposon silencing in Arabidopsis epihybrids	Genes and transposons can exist in variable DNA methylation states with potentially differential transcription. However, how these epialleles emerge is poorly understood. Here we show that crossing a hypomethylated plant with its normally methylated wild-type counterpart results already in the F1 generation in widespread changes in DNA methylation and transcription patterns. Novel non-parental and heritable epialleles arise at many genic loci, including a locus that itself controls DNA methylation patterns, but with most of the changes affecting pericentromeric transposons. While a subset of transposons show immediate resilencing, a large number displays decreased DNA methylation, which is associated with de novo or enhanced transcriptional activation. This can translate into transposon mobilization in the progeny. Our findings reveal that the combination of distinct epigenomes can be viewed as an epigenomic shock, which is characterized by a round of epigenetic variation creating novel patterns of gene and TE regulation.

PRJNA287063	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arginine methylation regulates widespread alternative polyadenylation	"Alternative polyadenylation (APA) has recently been recognized as a universal mechanism for gene regulation, but it remains unclear how APA is controlled. Here we report that the Arabidopsis thaliana Protein Arginine Methyltransferase 10 (AtPRMT10) regulates global APA with its protein partner HLP1, a conserved hnRNP A/B protein. HLP1 binds preferentially to A-rich and U-rich cis-elements around polyadenylation sites, thereby linking AtPRMT10 to the control of APA through protein-protein interactions. AtPRMT10 mutations cause significant proximal-to-distal poly(A) site shifts largely overlapping with those in hlp1-1 mutants. Proximal polyadenylation is maintained by AtPRMT10-directed methylation and is mediated in part by methylation of HLP1 at specific arginine residues. Our findings demonstrate that arginine methylation of an RNA-binding protein adds a novel layer of regulation to widespread alternative polyadenylation.

PRJNA291954	Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia Transcriptome or Gene expression	The debranching enzyme (DBR) is a conserved enzyme in eukaryotes that linearizes lariat RNAs formed as by-products of splicing to lead to their degradation. DBR is also necessary for the biogenesis of mirtron miRNAs, a class of nonconventional miRNAs that resides in introns and relies on splicing rather than the microprocessor for biogenesis. DBR is not known to affect the biogenesis of conventional miRNAs in either animals or plants. Here, we isolated and characterized a weak mutant allele of the DBR1 gene in Arabidopsis. In the dbr1 mutant, a global increase in lariat RNAs was unexpectedly accompanied by a global reduction in miRNA accumulation. Lariat RNAs were found to co-localize with the DCL1/HYL1 complex in the nucleus, and the dbr1 mutant exhibited defects in the subcellular localization of both DCL1 and HYL1. We propose that lariat RNAs act as decoys to inhibit miRNA homeostasis. The presence of lariat RNAs even in the wild-type background suggests that they may represent a previously unknown layer of regulation in miRNA biogenesis. Less...	
PRJNA292441	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts reveals a role for the nuclear messenger RNA cap-binding complex in plant co-translational RNA decay	"RNA turnover is necessary for controlling proper mRNA levels post-transcriptionally. In general, RNA degradation is via exoribonucleases that degrade RNA either from the 5’ end to the 3’ end, such as XRN4, or in the opposite direction by the multi-subunit exosome complex. Here, we use genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts to reveal the global landscape of co-translational mRNA decay in the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome. We found that this process leaves a clear three nucleotide periodicity in open reading frames. This pattern of co-translational degradation is especially evident near the ends of open reading frames, where we observe accumulation of cleavage events focused 16 to 17 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon because of ribosomal pausing during translation termination. Following treatment of Arabidopsis plants with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide, cleavage events accumulate 13 to 14 nucleotides upstream of the start codon where initiating ribosomes have been stalled with these sequences in their P site. Further analysis in xrn4 mutant plants indicates that co-translational RNA decay is XRN4-dependent. Additionally, studies in plants lacking CAP-BINDING PROTEIN80/ABA HYPERSENSITIVE1, the largest subunit of the nuclear mRNA cap-binding complex, reveal a role for this protein in co-translational decay. In total, our results demonstrate the global prevalence and features of co-translational RNA decay in a plant transcriptome.

PRJNA293514	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide profiling of SWI/SNF chromatin remodeler BRAHMA and Histone H3 lysine demethyalse Relative of Early Flowering 6 (REF6) in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq]	"BRAHMA (BRM) is a conserved SWI/SNF-type chromatin remodeling ATPase implicated in many key nuclear events. Histone H3 Lysine 27 (H3K27) demethylases specifically remove the repressive histone mark, trimethylation of H3K27 (H3K27me3). Both proteins are thought to play active roles in regulating gene activities at the chromatin level, but their genome-wide coordination remains to be determined. In Arabidopsis thaliana, RELATIVE OF EARLY FLOWERING 6 (REF6, also known as JMJ12) is the first identified plant H3K27 demethylase. Here, genome-wide analyses revealed that REF6 targets to thousands of genes across the Arabidopsis genome and co-localizes with BRM at more than 1,000 genes, many of which are genes involved in response to various stimuli, especially plant hormones. Loss of REF6 activity results in decreased BRM occupancy at hundreds of BRM-REF6 co-targets, indicating that REF6 is required for the recruitment of BRM to chromatin. Further, REF6 targets to genomic loci that contains the CTCTGTTT motif in vivo through its C2H2 zinger finger domains. Consistently, the two proteins activate the expression of a set of common genes in plant cells. Thus, this work demonstrates a genome-wide coordination between an H3K27me3 demethylase and a chromatin remodelling protein.

PRJEB9470	Col-0 and Kil-0 RNAseq analysisTranscriptome analysis of two Arabidopsis accessions	Plants integrate seasonal cues such as temperature and day length to optimally adjust their flowering time to the environment. Compared to the control of flowering before and after winter by the vernalization and day length pathways, mechanisms that delay or promote flowering during a transient cool or warm period, especially during spring, are less well known. Due to global warming, understanding this ambient temperature pathway has become increasingly important. FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) is one critical flowering regulator of this pathway in Arabidopsis thaliana. We identified the Arabidopsis accession Kil-0 as an early flowering strain when compared to the common reference accession Col-0. Genetic mapping of this trait identified a causative region of around 31 kb at the bottom of chromosome one. Within this region, only FLOWERING LOCUS M (FLM) was expressed at a significantly lower level in Kil-0 when comparing RNA-seq (RNA sequencing) data from 10-day old Kil-0 and Col-0 plants grown at 21°C. Furthermore, FLM was also the gene with the greatest reduction in gene expression between Kil-0 and Col-0 when we specifically analyzed 267 genes with a role in flowering time regulation what strongly suggested that FLM is the major locus that results in accelerated flowering in Kil-0.

The formation of the syncytium is orchestrated by the nematode in part by modulation of phytohormone responses, including cytokinin. In response to infection by the nematode H. schachtii, cytokinin signaling is transiently induced at the site of infection and in the developing syncytium. Arabidopsis lines with reduced cytokinin sensitivity show reduced susceptibility to nematode infection, indicating that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal nematode development. Furthermore, lines with increased cytokinin sensitivity also exhibit reduced nematode susceptibility. To ascertain why cytokinin hypersensitivity reduces nematode parasitism, we examined the transcriptomes in wild-type and a cytokinin-hypersensitive type-A arr Arabidopsis mutant in response to H. schachtii infection. Genes involved in the response to biotic stress and defense response were elevated in the type-A arr mutant in the absence of nematodes and were hyper-induced following H. schachtii infection, which suggests that the Arabidopsis type-A arr mutants impede nematode development because they are primed to respond to pathogen infection. These results suggest that cytokinin signaling is required for optimal H. schachtii parasitism of Arabidopsis, but that elevated cytokinin signaling triggers a heightened immune response to nematode infection.

PRJEB8886	Venturelli2015ChIPPlants release precursors of potent histone deacetylase inhibitors to suppress growth of competitors	To secure their access to water, light and nutrients, many plant species have developed allelopathic strategies to suppress competitors. To this end, they release phytotoxic substances that inhibit the germination and growth of neighbors. Despite the importance of allelopathy in shaping natural plant communities and for agricultural production, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here we report that allelo¬chemicals derived from the common class of cyclic hydroxamic acid root exudates directly affect the chromatin-modifying machinery in target plants. These substances act as inhibitors of histone deacetylases both in vitro and in vivo and exert their activity through locus-specific alterations of histone acetylation and associated gene expression. Our multilevel analysis thus collectively shows how plant-plant interactions interfere with a fundamental cellular process, histone acetylation, by targeting an evolutionarily highly conserved class of enzymes.

However, the underlying molecular mechanisms are largely unknown. Here, we characterize the physiological and molecular effects of correlative inhibition by seeds on Arabidopsis thaliana inflorescences, i.e. global proliferative arrest (GPA) during which all maternal growth ceases upon the production of a given number of seeds. We use laser-assisted microdissection and RNA-seq or Affymetrix GeneChip hybridizations to compare sterile growing, fertile growing and fertile arrested meristems or whole inflorescences. In shoot tissues, we detected the induction of stress- and senescence-related gene expression upon fruit production and GPA, and a drop in chlorophyll levels - suggestive of altered source-sink relationships between vegetative shoot and reproductive tissues. Levels of shoot reactive oxygen species, however, strongly decreased upon GPA - a phenomenon that is associated with bud dormancy in some perennials. Indeed, gene expression changes in arrested apical inflorescences after fruit removal resembled changes observed in axillary buds following release from apical dominance. This suggests that GPA represents a form of bud dormancy, and that dominance is gradually transferred from growing inflorescences to maturing seeds - allowing offspring control over maternal resources, simultaneously restricting offspring number.

PRJNA300452	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Temporal and spatial domain-specific transcriptomic analysis of a vital reproductive meristem in Arabidopsis thaliana	"Background: The carpel margin meristem is a vital multi-potent structure located in the medial domain of the Arabidopsis thaliana gynoecium, the female floral reproductive organ. The carpel margin meristem generates ovules that upon fertilization become seeds. The molecular mechanisms that specify this meristematic region and regulate its organogenic potential are poorly understood. Here, we present an analysis of the transcriptional profile of the medial domain of the Arabidopsis gynoecium highlighting the developmental stages that immediately proceed ovule initiation, the earliest stages of seed development.
Results: Using a floral synchronization system and a SHATTERPROOF2 domain-specific reporter construct, paired with fluorescence-activated cell sorting, we assayed the transcriptome of the gynoecial medial domain with temporal and spatial precision. Our analysis reveals a set of genes that are differentially-expressed within the SHATTERPROOF2 expression domain that marks portions of the developing medial domain. Many members of this gene set have been shown previously to function during the development of medial domain-derived structures, including the ovules, thus validating our approach. Other uncharacterized members of this gene set, including a set of differentially-expressed cis-natural antisense transcripts, are potential novel regulators of medial domain development and candidates for future functional studies. Several members of the REM family of transcriptional regulators were enriched in the SHP2-expressing cell population including a previously unrecognized REM family member (At5g60142). Analysis of the abundance of specific transcriptional isoforms identified genes that may exhibit “isoform switching” behavior during gynoecial development.
Conclusions: This data set provides genome-wide transcriptional insight into the development of the gynoecial medial domain that contains the carpel margin meristem, an important reproductive structure that gives rise to the ovules in Arabidopsis thaliana.
Overall design: Four samples (YFP-positive, YFP-negative, all-sorted, and non-sorted). Four biological replicates of each sample (except YFP-positive, collected in triplicated). Strand-specific libraries were sequenced (single-end) in two lanes of a HiSeq 2500 Illumina flow cell (each lane was later analyzed as a technical replicate). Less..."

Here, we use a combination of lineage tracing, single-cell RNA-seq, and marker analysis to test different models of tissue reassembly. We show that rapid cell-identity transitions lead to the formation of a new stem cell niche from multiple remnant tissues. The transcriptome of regenerating cells prior to stem cell activation resembled that of the embryonic root progenitor, and regeneration defects were more severe in embryonic versus adult root mutants. Furthermore, the signaling domains of the hormones auxin and cytokinin mirrored their embryonic dynamics, and manipulation of both hormones altered the position of new tissues and stem cell niche markers. Our findings suggest that plant organ regeneration resembles the developmental stages of embryonic patterning and is guided by spatial information laid down by complementary hormone domains.

PRJNA300685	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The chromatin remodeler protein DDM1 regulates early seedling growth hybrid vigor by modulating gene expression in Arabidopsis	"Despite of the paramount importance of heterosis in agriculture, the molecular mechanisms underlying heterosis remain elusive. Recent studies in Arabidopsis suggested possible involvement of DNA methylation in heterosis. We tested this hypothesis genetically by crossing homozygous mutants in DNA methylation-related genes in the Columbia (Col) ecotype with homozygous mutants in the same DNA methylation-related genes in the C24 ecotype. When genes in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway were mutated, the resultant F1 hybrids did not show appreciable loss of best parent heterosis (BPH) performances in early seedling growth. In contrast, mutations in the putative chromatin remodeling protein DECREASE OF DNA METHYLATION 1 (DDM1) caused ddm1-Col like growth pattern of ddm1-F1 hybrids, a mid-parent heterosis (MPH) performance. To understand the underlying molecular mechanisms, we compared the transcriptomes of the parental plants and reciprocal F1 hybrids in the wild type and ddm1 mutant backgrounds, and identified 183 non-additively expressed (NAE) genes, which were functionally enriched in defense response, a group of genes negatively associated with plant size. Interestingly, for the expression levels of the NAE genes, WT-F1 hybrids were enriched in the Golden Ration between mid-parent values (MPVs) and Col parents in WT, but ddm1-F1 hybrids were comparable to ddm1-Col parent in ddm1 mutant, which explained the MPH performance of ddm1-F1 hybrids. DNA methylation analyses revealed only one third of the NAE genes with highly methylated promoters whose expression is negatively associated with DNA methylation of promoters, strongly suggesting that DDM1 regulates heterosis by multiple epigenetic modifications.

PRJNA301055	Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Columbia (thale cress)Selecting superior de novo transcriptome assemblies: lessons learned by leveraging the best plant genome	Affordable, deep transcriptome sequencing comes with challenges including assembling reads that are shorter (~100bp) than the average mRNA transcript (~1000bp) and transcript abundance that spans orders of magnitude. Furthermore, no broadly accepted methods for evaluating de novo transcriptome assemblies have been established and rigorously tested with a high-quality reference genome. Here we present a detailed comparison of 99 transcriptome assemblies, generated with 6 de novo assemblers including CLC, Trinity, SOAP, Oases, ABySS and NextGENe (and reference guided assembly controls). We identify superior de novo assemblies using the Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryza sativa genomes, and recommend reference-independent quality metrics for de novo assembly validation. The leading assemblers are reassuringly good and robust to known assembly challenges. We identify novel assembly challenges manifested as high rates of false non-assembly in highly expressed genes. Surprisingly, the instance of true chimeric assemblies is very low for all assemblers, though non-assembly of closely related genes occurs in all assemblies, including reference-based controls. Normalized libraries are reduced in highly abundant transcripts, yet also lack 1000s of low abundance transcripts. Superior transcriptome assemblies are identified by only the combination of 1) a high proportion of reads that map to an assembly 2) efficient recovery of conserved genes, 3) expected N50 length statistics, and 4) more unigenes than expected transcripts. A key reference-based analysis allows visualization of assembly quality as a function of sequencing depth and shows a clear ranking of assemblers. de novo assembly of the Arabidopsis leaf transcriptome revealed ~20 putative Arabidopsis genes lacking in the current annotation. We estimated gene expression using de novo RNA-Seq and microarrays; RNA-Seq was superior and we report a novel strategy to improve the correlation of expression estimates between microarray and RNA-Seq.

PRJNA302221	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Albugo-imposed immunosuppression by compromised salicylate-triggered immunity and altered tryptophan-derived anti-microbial metabolite biosynthesis and bioavailability	"Infection by Albugo species, resulting in white rust disease, suppresses host plant immunity, and can even enable Albugo laibachii-infected Arabidopsis to support growth and reproduction of the non-host potato late blight pathogen Phytophthora infestans.  However, the mechanisms involved in non-host resistance remain to be elucidated. Here, we investigate specific host defense mechanisms that are suppressed by A. laibachii and A. candida infection, and compare the resistance contributed by indole glucosinolates and camalexin to that resulting from other components of defense induced by salicylic acid. We conclude a broad repertoire of host defense components contributes to non-host resistance in Arabidopsis to P. infestans, with a particular role for tryptophan-derived anti-microbial metabolites. Identifying the mechanisms involved in non-host resistance to pathogens such as P. infestans is necessary in the development of strategies to ensure future food security.
Overall design: 4-5 weeks old Arabidopsis (MAGIC-107: a multi-parent recombinant inbred line) plants were spray inoculated with either Mock or Albugo candida strain Nc2 or Albugo laibachii strain Nc14 , and infected plants were harvested at 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 days post-inoculation (dpi) for total RNA extraction. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, the receptor-like cytoplasmic kinase PBL27 interacts with the chitin receptor CERK1 and regulates chitin-induced MAPK activation. We found that the MAPK kinase kinase MAPKKK5 connects PBL27 to the downstream MAPK Kinases (MKK4/5) and MAPKs (MPK3/6). RNA-seq analysis using the mapkkk5 mutant indicated that MAPKKK5 plays important roles in chitin-induced transcriptional reprogramming.

Using a 2-fold change and a FDR (false discovery rate) of <0.05 as the cut-off for selecting the differentially expressed transcripts, we found that the expression of 581 genes was induced and that the expression of 120 genes was repressed by Pi starvation. We then compared the expression levels of these 581 PSI genes in the WT and phl2. The results showed that the average expression level of these genes was 51% lower in phl2 relative to the WT. If we arbitrarily defined a 30% reduction in the expression level of PSI genes as “a significant reduction”, the expression of 87.6% of PSI genes was significantly reduced in P- phl2 relative to P- WT seedlings. Thus, we conclude that PHL2 is a key component of the central regulatory system controlling transcriptional responses to Pi starvation.
Overall design: We performed a RNA-seq analysis on WT and phl2 plants. Total RNAs were extracted from the roots of P+ and P- WT seedlings (i.e., seedling grown on P-sufficient and P-deficient media) and of P- phl2 seedlings.

High confidence TFBS motifs for 529 TFs and genome-wide enrichment maps for 349 factors were identified. In total,~ 2.7 million TFBS were identified which predict thousands of TF target genes enriched for known and novel functions.. Comparison of TF-binding using cytosine-methylated and -unmethylated genomic DNA revealed a 2-50 fold inhibition at methylated motifs for ~82% (264) of factors tested while 4.6% (15) showed stronger binding to methylated motifs. Finally, we describe how binding of Arabidopsis and maize Auxin Response Factors (ARFs) at phased motif repeats is highly enriched at ARF target gene promoters and how this architecture may allow for stabilization of dimers/multimers.

One of the main types of SET domain proteins are those controlling H3K4 di- and trimethylation. The genome of Arabidopsis encodes 12 such proteins, including five ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX (ATX) proteins and seven ATX-Related (ATXR) proteins. Here we examined three until-now-unexplored ATX proteins, ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5. We found that they exhibit similar domain structures and expression patterns, and are redundantly required for vegetative and reproductive development. Concurrent disruption of the ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5 genes caused marked reduction in H3K4me2 and H3K4me3 levels genome-wide, and resulted in thousands of genes expressed ectopically. Furthermore, atx3/atx4/atx5 triple mutants resulted in exaggerated phenotypes when combined with the atx2 mutant but not with atx1. Together, we conclude that ATX3, ATX4, and ATX5 are redundantly required for H3K4 di- and trimethylation at thousands of sites located across the genome, and genomic features associated with targeted regions are different from the ATXR3/SDG2-controlled sites in Arabidopsis.

Seed development and metabolism are positively regulated by transcription factors belonging to the LAFL regulatory network.  The VAL gene family encodes repressors of the seed maturation program in germinating seeds, although they are also expressed during seed maturation.  VAL1 functions as a repressor of seed metabolism, as val1 mutant seeds accumulated elevated levels of storage proteins compared to the wild type.  Two VAL1 splice variants were identified through RNA sequencing analysis: a full-length and a truncated form lacking the plant-homeodomain-like domain associated with epigenetic repression.  None of the transcripts encoding the core LAFL network transcription factors were affected in val1 embryos.  Instead, activation of VAL1 by FUSCA3 appears to result in repression of a subset of seed maturation genes downstream of core LAFL regulators as 39% of transcripts in the FUSCA3 regulon were de-repressed in the val1 mutant.  The LEC1 and LEC2 regulons also responded but to a lesser extent.  Additional 832 transcripts that were not LAFL targets were de-repressed in val1 mutant embryos.

On the other hand, loading of 24-nt sRNAs results in transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) by RNA directed DNA methylation (RdDM). The Arabidopsis genome encodes 10 AGOs, which are known, for most, to belong to either pathway. Here we characterized the cell specific role of Arabidopsis AGO3. It is specifically expressed in tissue close to vascular termination and strongly accumulates in chalazal seed integuments. AGO3 encodes a functional AGO able to bind sRNAs with a preference for 24nt in length with a 5’ nucleotide bias for Adenosine. Down-regulation of AGO3 affects gene expression in siliques and its expression is strongly induced in the plant vasculature upon proteasome inhibition.

Alternative cleavage and polyadenylation (APA) generates mRNAs with different 3' UTRs, but the involvement of this process in stress response has not been clarified. Here, we report that a subset of stress-related genes exhibits 3' UTR extensions of their mRNAs during dehydration stress. These extended 3' UTRs have characteristics of long noncoding RNAs and likely do not interact with miRNAs. Functional studies using T-DNA insertion mutants reveal that they can function as antisense transcripts to repress expression levels of sense genes from the opposite strand, or can activate the transcription of downstream genes from the same strand. Poly(A) signal analysis reveal that mRNAs with 3' UTR extensions have weaker poly(A) signals than mRNAs without 3' UTR extensions. Finally, we show that their biogenesis is partially dependent on a trans-acting factor FPA. Taken together, we report that dehydration stress could induce mRNA 3' UTR extensions, and elucidate a novel function for these stress-induced 3' UTR extensions as long noncoding RNAs in the regulation of their neighboring genes.

Passage of Pi across vacuolar membranes plays a critical role in buffering the cytoplasmic Pi level against fluctuations of external Pi and metabolic activities. Here we demonstrate that the SPX-MFS proteins, designated as Phosphate Transporter 5 family (PHT5), also named Vacuolar Phosphate Transporter (VPT), function as vacuolar Pi transporters. Based on 31P-magnetic resonance spectroscopy analysis, Arabidopsis pht5;1 loss-of-function mutants accumulate less Pi and exhibit a lower vacuolar-to-cytoplasmic Pi ratio than controls. Conversely, overexpression of PHT5 leads to massive Pi sequestration into vacuoles and altered regulation of Pi starvation-responsive genes. Furthermore, we show that heterologous expression of OsSPX-MFS1, the rice PHT5 homolog, mediates Pi influx to yeast vacuoles. Our findings uncover a group of Pi transporters in vacuolar membranes that regulate the cytoplasmic Pi homeostasis required for the fitness of plant growth.

RNA sequencing was performed to identify the ABA regulated root genes that are also regulated by BR signaling components.Our result demonstrated that BR signaling negative regulates plant ABA response, and the crosstalk is mediated by BIN2 and BZR1. RNA sequencing has identified subsets of ABA responsive root genes that were regulated by BIN2 and/or BZR1. ChIP-qPCR and EMSA assays showed that BZR1 could bind directly with several G-box cis-elements on ABI5 promoter, suppress the expression of ABI5 and makes plant insensitive to ABA.These data demonstrated that ABI5 is a BZR1 direct targeted gene. Regulation of ABI5 expression by BZR1 plays important roles in regulating the crosstalk between BR and ABA signaling pathways.

PRJNA304946	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Translatome analysis of NB-LRR immune response identifies important contributors to plant immunity in Arabidopsis.	"An important branch of plant immunity involves the recognition of pathogens by the NB-LRR proteins encoded by disease resistance genes. However, signaling events downstream of NB-LRR activation are poorly understood. We have analyzed the Arabidopsis translatome using ribosome affinity purification and RNAseq. Our results show that the translational status of hundreds of genes are differentially affected upon activation of the NB-LRR protein RPM1, showing an overall pattern of a switch away from growth-related activities to defense. Among these is the central translational regulator and growth promoter, TOR kinase. Suppression of TOR expression leads to increased resistance to pathogens while overexpression of TOR results in increased susceptibility, indicating an important role for translational control in the growth to defense switch. Furthermore, we show that several additional genes whose mRNAs are translationally regulated, including BIG, CCT2 and CIPK5, are required for plant innate immunity, identifying novel actors in plant defense.
Overall design: Cellular extracts of Arabidopsis Avr/L18 at 2h after spraying with DEX (30μM) or water (control) were prepared for ribosome IP followed by RNA purification. Total RNA from the same samples was purified in parallel. NGS libraries were prepared in biological triplicate for each treatment and RNA fraction (total and ribosome IP). Sequencing was performed on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 system at the Broad Institute of Massachusets Institute of Technology. Total RNA and ribosomebound mRNAs libraries were pairedend sequenced on two independent sequencing lanes as multiplexed samples. Raw demultiplexed fastq files are provided for each replicate.

DMS was added to a final concentration of 0.75% (~75 mM) and allowed to react for 15 min at room temperature with periodic swirling. To quench the reaction, freshly-prepared dithiothreitol (DTT) was added to a final concentration of 0.5 M, and after swirling for 2 min the reaction mixture was decanted and the seedlings were washed with ~2 x 50 mL of deionized water. The seedlings were immediately frozen with liquid N2 and subjected to total RNA extraction, following the protocol described in the RNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen). In vivo total RNA isolation was followed by two rounds of poly(A) selection using the Poly(A) purist Kit (Ambion).

"mRNA sequencing was used to identify genes differentially expressed in  Delta1-pyrroline-5-carboxylate synthase1-4 (p5cs1-4) mutants deficient in low water potential-induced proline accumulation and the Abscisic Acid (ABA) deficient mutant aba2-1 compared to Col-0 wild type.  Three treatments were analyzed for each genotype: unstressed control, a 96 hour low water potential (-1.2 MPa) treatment and a stress-release treatment where seedlings were removed from the stress treatment and transferred back to control media for 10 hours.  Approximately 100 genes were found to be significantly up-regulated in p5cs1-4 compared to wild type in both the control and stress treatments with an equal number down regulated.  There was also a substantial transcription response to the stress release treatment which varied between wild type, p5cs1-4 and aba2-1.

However, the functions of nuclear-localized RNA binding proteins in plants are poorly understood. Here we report the functions of two proteins containing RNA recognition motifs, At RZ-1B and At RZ-1C, in Arabidopsis. At RZ-1B and At RZ-1C were localized to nuclear speckles and interacted with a spectrum of serine/arginine-rich (SR) proteins through their C-termini. At RZ-1C preferentially bound to purine-rich RNA sequences in vitro through its N-terminal RNA recognition motif. Disrupting the RNA-binding activity of At RZ-1C with SR proteins through over-expression of the C-terminus of At RZ-1C conferred defective phenotypes similar to those observed in At rz-1b/At rz-1c double mutants, including delayed seed germination, reduced stature, and serrated leaves. Loss of function of At RZ-1B and At RZ-1C was accompanied by defective splicing of many genes and global perturbation of gene expression. In addition, we found that At RZ-1C directly targeted FLC, promoting efficient splicing of FLC introns and likely also repressing FLC transcription. Our findings highlight the critical role of At RZ-1B/1C in regulating RNA splicing, gene expression, and many key aspects of plant development via interaction with proteins including SR proteins.

PRJNA255977	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Cryptochromes interact directly with PIFs to control plant growth in limiting blue light	"Sun-loving plants have the ability to detect and avoid shading through sensing of both blue and red light wavelengths. Higher plant cryptochromes (CRYs) control how plants modulate growth in response to changes in blue light. For growth under a canopy, where blue light is diminished, CRY1 and CRY2 perceive this change and respond by directly contacting two bHLH transcription factors, PIF4 and PIF5. These factors are also known to be controlled by phytochromes, the red/far-red photoreceptors; however, transcriptome analyses indicate that the gene regulatory programs induced by the different light wavelengths are distinct. Our results indicate that CRYs signal by modulating PIF activity genome-wide, and that these factors integrate binding of different plant photoreceptors to facilitate growth changes under different light conditions.

PRJEB12204	Transcriptional response of Arabidopsis thaliana in systemic acquired resistance: critical roles for pipecolic acid and salicylic acid	We investigated the relationships of the two immune-regulatory plant metabolites salicylic acid (SA) and pipecolic acid (Pip) in the establishment of plant systemic acquired resistance (SAR) in Arabidopsis thaliana induced by the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae. To characterize the transcriptional SAR response, we used wild-type Col-0 plants, SA-deficient sid2 plants and Pip-deficient ald1 plants and performed RNA-sequencing analyses (Bernsdorff et al., Plant Cell, 2016). SAR establishment in the wild-type is characterized by a strong transcriptional response systemically induced in the foliage that prepares plants for future pathogen attack by pre-activating multiple stages of defense signaling. Whereas systemic Pip elevations are indispensable for SAR and necessary for virtually the whole transcriptional SAR response, a moderate but significant SA-independent component of SAR activation and SAR gene expression is revealed. Arabidopsis thaliana plants were grown individually in pots containing a mixture of soil, vermiculite and sand (8:1:1) in a controlled cultivation chamber with a 10-h day (9 AM to 7 PM; photon flux density 100 mol m-2 s-1) / 14-h night cycle and a relative humidity of 70 %. Day and night temperatures were set to 21C and 18C, respectively. Experiments were performed with 5- to 6-week-old, naive plants exhibiting a uniform appearance. To activate SAR, plants were infiltrated between 10 AM and 12 AM into three lower (1) leaves with suspensions of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. maculicola (OD600 = 0.005). Infiltration with 10 mM MgCl2 served as the mock-control treatment. Upper (2) leaves were harvested 48 h after the primary treatment for the determination of systemic gene expression by RNA-seq analyses. Three biologically independent, replicate SAR induction experiments were performed with Col-0 and sid2 plants (experimental set 1), and three other biologically independent experiments with Col-0 and ald1 plants (experimental set 2). In each SAR experiment, at least 6 upper (2) leaves from 6 different plants pre-treated in 1 leaves with Psm (MgCl2) were pooled for one biological Psm- (mock-control) replicate. In this way, 3 biologically independent, replicate samples per treatment and plant genotype were obtained within each SAR set. Less...

PRJEB9489	Bisulfite-Seq and RNA-seq in rootstock of Arabidopsis thaliana grafts	RNA silencing is a mechanism for regulating gene expression at the transcriptional and post-transcriptional levels. Its functions include regulating endogenous gene expression and protecting the cell against viruses and invading transposable elements (TEs). A key component of the mechanism is small RNAs (sRNAs) of 21-24 nucleotides (nt) in length, which direct the silencing machinery in a sequence specific manner to target nucleic acids. sRNAs of 24 nt are involved in methylation of cytosine residues of target loci in three sequence contexts (CG, CHG and CHH), referred to as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). We previously demonstrated that 24 nt sRNAs are mobile from shoot to root in Arabidopsis thaliana. In this study we demonstrated that methylation of thousands of loci in root tissues is dependent upon mobile sRNAs from the shoot. Furthermore, we found that mobile sRNA-dependent DNA methylation occurs predominantly in non-CG contexts. These findings were made using base-resolution next generation sequencing approaches and genome wide analyses. Specific classes of short TEs are the predominant targets of mobile sRNA-dependent DNA methylation; classes typically found in gene-rich euchromatic regions. Mobile sRNA-regulated genes were also identified. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that mobile sRNA-dependent non-CG methylation is largely independent of the CMT2/3 RdDM pathway but dependent upon the DRM1/DRM2 RdDM pathway. This is in contrast to non-mobile sRNA-dependent DNA methylation, which predominantly depends upon the CMT2/3 RdDM pathway.  These data are complementary to the small RNA sequencing data from Arabidopsis root grafts described in Molnar et al (Science, 2010 May 14;328(5980):872-5). Less...

Transposable elements (TEs) are widely distributed in many eukaryotic genomes, and often account for large fractions of plant and animal genomes. By using strand-specific RNA sequencing, we profiled the expression patterns of lincRNAs in Arabidopsis, rice and maize, and identified TE-associated lincRNAs (TE-lincRNAs). Stress regulation of some TE-lincRNAs was observed in Arabidopsis. Our findings indicate that TE-associated lincRNAs potentially play important roles in plant abiotic stress responses. Moreover, in the Arabidopsis chromatin remodelling mutant ddm1 that has an altered chromatin state, novel lincRNAs including TE-lincRNAs were generated. The novel lincRNAs were inherited in the subsequent generations in the wild type background, suggesting that lincRNAs could act as an adaptive reservoir in eukaryotes.

To unravel the molecular mechanisms that regulate the response towards an impact of increased H2O2 levels in plant cells, we focused on the photorespiration-dependent peroxisomal H2O2 production in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking CATALASE2 (CAT2) activity (cat2-2) and screened for second-site mutations that attenuate the Fv'/Fm' decrease and lesion formation linked to the cat2-2 phenotype. A mutation in the transcriptional regulator SHORT-ROOT (SHR) of the GRAS family rescued the cell death phenotype of cat2-2 plants under photorespiration-promoting conditions in a SCR-independent way, and provoked perturbation of photorespiratory metabolites. SHR deficiency boosted ascorbate levels and prevented the oxidation of the glutathione pool in cat2-2 background upon exposure to photorespiratory stress. These results reveal an unanticipated role for SHR as a regulator of cellular redox homeostasis.

PRJNA309654	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis GLYCOLATE OXIDASE 1 and 2 display divergent roles under conditions promoting photorespiration	"Hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) can act as a signaling molecule that influences various aspects of plant growth and development, including stress signaling and cell death. To unravel the molecular mechanisms that regulate the response towards an impact of increased H2O2 levels in plant cells, we focused on the photorespiration-dependent peroxisomal H2O2 production in Arabidopsis thaliana mutants lacking CATALASE2 (CAT2) activity (cat2-2) and screened for second-site mutations that attenuate the Fv'/Fm' decrease and lesion formation linked to the cat2-2 phenotype. A mutation in GLYCOLATE OXIDASE 1, encoding one of the two photorespiratory isoforms of glycolate oxidase rescued the cell death phenotype of cat2-2 plants under photorespiration-promoting conditions. Interestingly, introduction of gox2 into the cat2 background did not have the same effect and the double cat2 gox2 mutants were as affected as the parental cat2 mutants under conditions promoting photorespiration. Using a series of physiological, biochemical and metabolomic approaches we investigated the differential photorespiratory response of cat2 mutants underlied by the lack of GOX1 and GOX2. These differences are in line with the non-redundant functions of GOX1 and GOX2 which could be observed under enhanced photorespiration.

PRJNA309713	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)GC-rich coding sequences reduce transposon-like sRNA-mediated transgene silencing in Arabidopsis and maize	"The molecular basis of transgene susceptibility to silencing is poorly characterized in plants, thus we evaluated several transgene design parameters as means to reduce heritable sRNA-mediated transgene silencing. Analyses of Arabidopsis plants with transgenes encoding a microalgal polyunsaturated fatty acid (PUFA) synthase revealed that small RNA (sRNA)-mediated silencing, combined with the use of repetitive regulatory elements, led to aggressive transposable element (TE)-like silencing of canola-biased PUFA transgenes. Diversifying regulatory sequences and using native microalgal coding sequences (CDSs) with higher GC content improved transgene expression and resulted in remarkable trans-generational stability via reduced accumulation of sRNAs and DNA methylation. Further experiments in maize with transgenes individually expressing three Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) crystal proteins tested the impact of CDSs recoding using different codon bias tables. Transgenes with the higher GC content exhibited increased transcript and protein accumulation. These results demonstrate that the sequence composition of transgene CDSs can directly impact silencing providing design strategies for increasing transgene expression levels and reducing risks of heritable loss of transgene expression.

PRJNA311764	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Identification of Multiple Proteins Coupling Transcriptional Regulation to Genome Stability in Arabidopsis thaliana	"Eukaryotic genomes are heavily regulated by epigenetic marks that often act to modulate the transcriptional control of genetic elements. In Arabidopsis thaliana the ATXR5 and ATXR6 histone methyltransferases, and their cognate H3K27 monomethylation mark, act in transcriptional silencing while also maintaining genome stability by preventing generation of excess DNA corresponding to pericentromeric heterochromatin. In this study we characterize the atxr5 atxr6 transcriptome and its relationship to the DNA damage response which suggests that the atxr5 atxr6 transcriptional defects may be epistatic to the genome instability defects in the mutants. In addition we isolate several factors that modulate both the transcriptional and genomic instability phenotypes of atxr5 atxr6 mutants, which suggest a mechanism for atxr5 atxr6-induced extra DNA involving conflicts between the replicative and transcriptional processes in the cell.

PRJNA311725	Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Col-0 (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana cultivar:Col-0 Raw sequence reads	The chloroplast-localized RNA helicase INCREASED SIZE EXCLUSION LIMIT2 (ISE2) is indispensable for proper plant development, and ise2 mutants are embryonically lethal. Importantly, loss of ISE2 in embryos is associated with increased intercellular trafficking that positively correlates with increased formation of plasmodesmata (PD). Intriguingly, phylogenetic analyses reveal that the ISE2 DEVH-type RNA helicase is conserved in all green photosynthetic organisms examined to date, suggesting that its functions are closely related to oxygenic photosynthesis. We show that ISE2 has the potential to interact with numerous chloroplast-localized proteins, and the interaction with the plastid ribosomal protein L15 (RPL15) was confirmed in vivo by co-immunoprecipitation. We also demonstrate that similar to ISE2, RPL15 is an essential gene, and depending on the approach plants depleted of RPL15 consistently develop chlorotic leaves or are embryonic lethal, as do ISE2-depleted plants. In addition, chloroplast-encoded proteins accumulate to lower levels in RPL15-depleted leaves, consistent with its role as a ribosomal protein. Some nucleus-encoded chloroplast proteins should little or no changes on loss of RPL15, suggesting that the effect on chloroplast proteins was specific. Notably, loss of RPL15 results in increased PD formation that positively correlates with increased intercellular trafficking in affected leaves. Collectively, these data support the emerging hypothesis that chloroplasts have an important role in regulating intercellular trafficking and PD biogenesis. Less...

Sepals are the protective organs of flowers in the thale cress A. thaliana; LGO/SMR1 is an inhibitor of cyclin-dependent kinases (CDKs) from the SIAMESE-related (SMR) family.

"Plant immunity protects plants from numerous potentially pathogenic microbes. The biological network that controls plant inducible immunity must function effectively even when network components are targeted and disabled by pathogen effectors. Network buffering could confer this robustness by allowing different parts of the network to compensate for loss of each other’s functions. Networks rich in buffering rely on interactions within the network, but these mechanisms are difficult to study by simple genetic means. Through a network reconstitution strategy, where we disassemble and stepwise reassemble the plant immune network that mediates Pattern-Triggered-Immunity, we have resolved systems-level regulatory mechanisms underlying the Arabidopsis transcriptome response to the immune stimulant flagellin-22 (flg22). These mechanisms show widespread evidence of interactions among major sub-networks—the components that we call sectors—in the flg22-responsive transcriptome. Many of these interactions result in network buffering. Resolved regulatory mechanisms also show unexpected patterns for how the jasmonate (JA), ethylene (ET), phytoalexin-deficient 4 (PAD4), and salicylate (SA) signaling sectors control the transcriptional response to flg22. We demonstrate that many of these mechanisms are hidden from the traditional genetic approach of single-gene null-mutant analysis. As potential pathogenic perturbations to the network, null-mutant effects can be buffered by the immune network as well.
Overall design: We profiled the Arabidopsis thaliana response to flg22 infiltration in the wild type (Col-0), as well as 4 single-gene mutants, 6 double-gene mutants, 4 triple-gene mutants, a quadruple-gene mutant for the null-mutant alleles dde2-2, ein2-1, pad4-1, and sid2-2, as well as a control genotype, fls2, which has a null-mutation in the flg22 receptor gene. Profiles were collected through a detailed time course 0, 1, 2, 3, 5, 9, and 18 hrs after infiltration. 0 hrs samples were untouched. Three biological replicates were profiled for each genotype:time combination. Each biological replicate was collected from the pooled tissue of 4 independent biological experiments. In each of these experiments, 3 leaves, leaf stages 7-9, of 31-32 days old plants were infiltrated with 1uM flg22 and collected at the indicated timepoint. Thus each biological replicate contained the tissue of 4*3 = 12 leaves. In total, 357 separate samples were sequenced: 17 genotypes * 7 time points * 3 biological replicates = 357. Internal barcodes—the first 4-8 bases of the sequence—were used to multiplex stranded mRNA Tag-Seq libraries (1) for sets of 16 samples each into a single lane of an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIX flowcell.

PRJNA314105	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis AtMORC4 and AtMORC7 form Nuclear Bodies and Repress a Large Number of Protein-Coding Genes	"The MORC family of GHKL ATPases are an enigmatic class of proteins with diverse chromatin related functions. In Arabidopsis, AtMORC1, AtMORC2, and AtMORC6 act together in heterodimeric complexes to mediate transcriptional silencing of methylated DNA elements. Here, we studied Arabidopsis AtMORC4 and AtMORC7. We found that, in contrast to AtMORC1,2,6, they act to suppress a wide set of non-methylated protein-coding genes that are enriched for those involved in pathogen response. Furthermore, atmorc4 atmorc7 double mutants show a pathogen response phenotype. We found that AtMORC4 and AtMORC7 form homomeric complexes in vivo and are concentrated in discrete nuclear bodies adjacent to chromocenters. Analysis of an atmorc1,2,4,5,6,7 hextuple mutant demonstrates that transcriptional de-repression is largely uncoupled from changes in DNA methylation in plants devoid of MORC function. However, we also uncover a requirement for MORC in both DNA methylation and silencing at a small but distinct subset of RNA-directed DNA methylation target loci. These regions are characterized by poised transcriptional potential and a low density of sites for symmetric cytosine methylation. These results provide insights into the biological function of MORC proteins in higher eukaryotes.

However, the function of POLD2, the second small subunit of DNA polymerase δ, has not been characterized yet in Arabidopsis. During a genetic screen for release of TGS, we identified a mutation in POLD2. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing indicated that POLD2 is not involved in the regulation of DNA methylation. POLD2 genetically interacts with ATR and DNA polymerase α. The pold2-1 mutant exhibits genomic instability with a high frequency of homologous recombination (HR). It also exhibits hypersensitivity to DNA-damaging reagents, and short telomere length. Whole-genome ChIP-seq and RNA-seq analyses suggest that pold2-1 changes H3K27me3 and H3K4me3 modifications, and these changes are correlated with the gene expression levels. Our study suggest that POLD2 is required for maintaining genome integrity, and properly establishing the epigenetic markers during DNA replication to modulate gene expression.

PRJNA315570	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide analysis of transcription, H2A.Z, nucleosomes and HSF1 dynamics in response to temperature increase in Arabidopsis thaliana [RNA-seq I]	"Plants are sessile organisms and therefore must sense and respond to changes of their surrounding conditions such as ambient temperature, which vary diurnally and seasonally. It is not yet clear how plants sense temperature and integrate this information into their development. We have previously shown that H2A.Z-nucleosomes are evicted in response to warmer temperatures. It is not clear however, whether the link between transcriptional responsiveness and changes in H2A.Z binding in context of temperature shifts is a global trend that can be seen throughout the genome, or the phenomenon is specific to a specialised set of temperature-responsive genes. In addition to the role of H2A.Z-nucleosome dynamics in the transcriptional response to temperature, it was shown that genes strongly misregulated in the h2a.z mutant are enriched for gene categories involved in response to multiple environmental cues. This suggests that H2A.Z could be implicated in the transcriptional response to various environmental inputs, raising the question: What brings the specificity of H2A.Z dynamics in response to temperature? To address this question we have profiled H2A.Z-nucleosome occupancy genome wide (using ChIP-seq) during a time course after temperature variation and compared its dynamics to transcriptional changes. We identified a fast, targeted and transient eviction of H2A.Z associated with transcriptional activation in response to temperature for a few hundreds genes. This eviction is associated with a reduction of the stability of the nucleosome. Moreover the genes with a fast H2A.Z eviction were strongly enriched in heat shock elements in their promoter and we observed a strong association between HSF1 binding and H2AZ eviction at warm temperature. These results highlight the importance of the interplay between transcription factors and chromatin to allow a controlled and dynamics response to temperature.

PRJNA315773	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)FPS down-regulation alters chloroplast development and triggers an sterol-dependent induction of JA-related and Fe deficiency transcriptional responses	"In order to study the role of Farnesyl diphosphate synthase (FPS) in post-embryonic plant development, we generated Arabidopsis conditional knockdown mutants expressing amiRNAs devised to simultaneously silence both FPS (FPS1 and FPS2) genes. The expression of the amiRNAs is regulated by using a methoxyfenozide (MFZ) inducible promoter. An RNAseq analysis was made to compare the differentially expressed genes between control (not induced)  and silenced (MFZ-induced) amiFPSa Arabidopsis seedlings. Differential gene expression analysis shows that a reduction in FPS activity levels triggers misregulation of genes involved in biotic and abiotic stress responses, the most prominent being the rapid induction of a set of genes related to the jasmonic acid (JA) pathway. Down-regulation of FPS also triggered a Fe-deficiency transcriptional response that is consistent with the Fe-deficient status observed in FPS silenced plants.
Overall design: To induce FPS gene silencing, seedlings were germinated and grown for three days on sterile filter papers that were first placed on MS plates and subsequently transferred onto new MS plates supplemented (treatment) or not (control) with 30 µM MFZ for five days more. Three independent pools of seedlings (100 mg of FW) were collected per each treatment. Seedlings were ground to a fine powder using TissueLyser equipment and used for extraction of RNA. The quality and quantity of total RNA samples were assessed using a Bionalyzer Expert 2100 Instrument (Agilent Technologies) and an equimolar mixture of RNA samples from each treatment was prepared.

The PD localizing proteins (PDLP) 1 and 5, which regulate PD permeability, are involved in SAR; PD permeability is comparable to or ~25% higher than wild-type plants in the SAR defective pdlp1 and 5 mutants, respectively. Interestingly, constitutive or inducible overexpression of PDLP5, which drastically reduces (~70%) PD permeability, also impaires SAR. PDLP1 interacts with AZI1 (required for AzA- and G3P-induced SAR) and contributes to the intracellular partitioning of this lipid transfer-like protein. Together, these results reveal the transport routes of SAR chemical signals and highlight the regulatory role of PD localizing proteins in SAR. Less...

PRJNA316045	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	High-throughput approaches for profiling the 5' ends of RNA degradation intermediates on a genome-wide scale are frequently applied in the validation of cleavage sites guided by microRNAs (miRNAs). However, the complexity of the RNA degradome beyond miRNA targets currently is largely unclear which limits the application of degradome. We provide multiple lines of evidence to show that ribosome footprints are widespread in the plant degradome. A 3-nt periodicity and a bias toward the translational frame were observed in the analysis of 5’ truncated mRNA ends mapped to the coding sequence (CDS). In addition, predominant 5’ termini of RNA degradation intermediates separated by a length equal to a ribosome-protected fragment were evident in the conserved peptide upstream open reading frames (uORFs). Through the analysis of degradome data, we uncovered novel ribosome stalling uORFs including a lineage specific uORF in the Brassicaceae family. Phased degradation signatures of stacked ribosomes were also identified in the CDS of multiple genes. Furthermore, we show that the binding of ARGONAUTE7 to a non-cleavable target site of miR390 might directly hinder ribosome movement. This work shows that the RNA degradome contains in vivo ribosome-protected mRNA fragments and demonstrates an alternative use of degradome data in the study of ribosome stalling. Less...

This modification has been shown to be reversible in mammals; it is installed by a methyltransferase heterodimer complex of METTL3 and METTL14 bound with WTAP, and reversed by iron(II)- and α-ketoglutarate-dependent demethylases FTO and ALKBH5. This modification exhibits significant functional roles in various biological processes. The m6A modification as a RNA mark is recognized by reader proteins, such as YTH domain family proteins and HNRNPA2B1; m6A can also act as a structure switch to affect RNA-protein interactions for biological regulation. In Arabidopsis thaliana, the methyltransferase subunit MTA (the plant orthologue of human METTL3, encoded by At4g10760) was well characterized and FIP37 (the plant orthologue of human WTAP) was first identified as the interacting partner of MTA. Here we report the discovery and characterization of reversible m6A methylation mediated by AtALKBH10B (encoded by At4g02940) in A. thaliana, and noticeable roles of this RNA demethylase in affecting plant development and floral transition. Our findings reveal potential broad functions of reversible mRNA methylation in plants.

The mechanism of this differential regulation of cell enlargement is unclear. Our organ-specific transcriptomic analysis identified 32 Small Auxin Up RNA (SAUR) genes whose transcripts were light-induced in cotyledons and/or repressed in hypocotyls. We therefore named these SAURs as lirSAURs. Both overexpression and mutation analyses demonstrated that lirSAURs could promote cotyledon expansion and opening and enhance hypocotyl elongation, possibly by inhibiting phosphatase activity of PP2C-Ds. Light reduced auxin levels to down-regulate the expression of lirSAURs in hypocotyls. Further, phytochrome-interacting factors (PIFs) were shown

Here, using re-sequencing data for 210 Arabidopsis thaliana accessions taken from across the globe, we show recent transposition activity for half of the ~330 transposable element families present in this plant species. Furthermore, we uncover extensive variation in the composition of the mobilome between accessions. Genome-wide association studies reveal a complex genetic architecture, involving the transposable elements themselves and diverse gene loci, notably that encoding the DNA methyltransferase MET2. Most transpositions occur near or within genes and affect their expression and DNA methylation status. Remarkably, loci controlling adaptive responses to the environment such as pathogen resistance (NLR) and flowering time (FLC) are the most frequent transposition targets.

The resulting gene dosage imbalance usually has a deleterious effect on the phenotype, as illustrated in humans by Down Syndrome (trisomy 21) and solid tumor cells, which are typically highly aneuploid. Aneuploidy has been studied for many years in plants and has been a factor contributing to plant chromosome evolution. Nevertheless, there is still relatively little information about how chromosome numerical imbalances affect the molecular constitution of cells and confer altered phenotypes. To investigate these questions we have performed comparative transcriptome (RNA-seq) and methylome (bisulfite-seq) analyses on trisomics (2n+1) of all five chromosomes of Arabidopsis thaliana as well as matched diploids, triploid and tetraploids.
Overall design: Trisomics of each of the five Arabidopsis thaliana chromosomes were screened out microscopically at the seedling stage from a population of selfed progeny of a triploid parent using fluorescent-tags on specific chromosomes as markers. The triploid parents are obtained as progeny from a cross between a diploid and a tetraploid. The trisomics were grown in soil and the number of chromosomes was confirmed by counting metaphase chromosomes prepared from flower pistils and by comparative genome hybridization. At least two biological replicates representing each confirmed karyotype (trisomies 1 through 5, diploid, triploid, tetraploid) were used for DNA and RNA isolation.

Here, we report single-base resolution whole genome DNA methylomes, mRNA transcriptomes, and small RNA transcriptomes for six cell populations covering the major cell types of the Arabidopsis root meristem. We identify widespread cell type specific patterns of DNA methylation, especially in the CHH sequence context. The genome of the columella root cap is the most highly methylated Arabidopsis cell characterized to date. It is hypermethylated within transposable elements, accompanied by increased abundance of transcripts encoding RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway components and 24 nt small RNAs. Absence of the nucleosome remodeler DECREASED DNA METHYLATION 1, required for maintenance of DNA methylation, and low abundance of histone transcripts involved in heterochromatin formation suggests a loss of heterochromatin may occur in the columella, thus allowing access of RdDM factors to the whole genome, and producing excess 24 nt small RNAs in this tissue. Together, these maps provide new insights into the epigenomic diversity that exists between distinct plant somatic cell types.

Here, FEN1 was cloned as a suppressor of transcriptional gene silencing (TGS) from a forward genetic screen.

Arabidopsis fen1-1 mutant is hypersensitive to MMS and shows reduced telomere length. Interestingly, genome-wide ChIP-seq and RNA-seq results demonstrate that FEN1 mutation leads to a decrease in the H3K27me3 level and an increase in the expression of a subset of genes marked with H3K27me3. Overall, these results uncover a role for FEN1 in mediating TGS besides maintaining genome stability in Arabidopsis.

PRJNA311774	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Raw sequence reads	The historic developmental hourglass concept depicts the convergence of animal embryos to a common form during the phylotypic period. Recently, it has been shown that a transcriptomic hourglass is associated with this morphological pattern, consistent with the idea of underlying selective constraints due to intense molecular interactions during body plan establishment. Although plants do not exhibit a morphological hourglass during embryogenesis, a transcriptomic hourglass has nevertheless been identified in the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We generated this dataset as part of a study to investigate whether plant hourglass patterns are also found post-embryonically. We found that the two main phase changes during the life cycle of Arabidopsis, from embryonic to vegetative and from vegetative to reproductive development, are associated with transcriptomic hourglass patterns. This suggests that plant hourglass patterns are decoupled from organogenesis and body plan establishment. Less...

PRJNA317322	Auxin signaling in the epidermis regulates stem growth via interactions with the brassinosteroid pathway	"Growth of a complex multicellular organism requires coordinated changes in diverse cell types.  These cellular changes generate organs of the correct size, shape and functionality.  During plant development, the growth hormone auxin induces stem elongation; however, which cell types of the stem perceive the auxin signal and contribute to organ growth is poorly understood.  Here, we show that auxin signalling is required in many cell types for correct hypocotyl stem growth, with a key role for the epidermis.  Combining genetic manipulations in Arabidopsis thaliana with transcriptional profiling of the hypocotyl epidermis from Brassica rapa, we show that auxin functions in the epidermis in part by inducing activity of the locally-acting, growth-promoting brassinosteroid pathway.  Our findings clarify cell-specific auxin function in the hypocotyl, and highlight the complexity of cell-type interactions within a growing organ.

In Arabidopsis thaliana, an RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway is involved in transcriptional silencing. Noncoding RNAs produced by the plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase V are required for RNA-directed DNA methylation. A chromatin-remodeling complex was previously demonstrated to be required for the occupancy of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase V at RNA-directed DNA methylation loci. 
Our results suggest that two putative histone methyltransferases are inactive in their enzymatic activity and act as adaptor proteins to facilitate the recruitment of DNA-dependent RNA polymerase V to chromatin by associating with the chromatin-remodeling complex. In combination with previous studies, we propose that the inactive histone methyltransferases bind to methylated DNA, thereby linking DNA methylation to Pol V transcription at RNA-directed DNA methylation loci.

Here, we report that two PIAS (PROTEIN INHIBITOR OF ACTIVATED STAT)-type SUMO E3 ligase-like proteins PIAL1 and PIAL2 function redundantly to mediate transcriptional silencing at MOM1 target loci. PIAL1 and PIAL2 physically interact with each other and with MOM1 to form a high-molecular-weight complex. In the absence of either PIAL2 or MOM1, the formation of the high-molecular-weight complex was disrupted. We identified a previously uncharacterized IND (interacting domain) in PIAL1 and PIAL2, and demonstrated that IND directly interacts with MOM1.
The CMM2 (conserved MOM1 motif 2) domain of MOM1 was previously shown to be required for the dimerization of MOM1. We demonstrated that the CMM2 domain is also required for the interaction of MOM1 with PIAL1 and PIAL2. We found that although PIAL2 has a SUMO E3 ligase activity, the activity is dispensable for PIAL2 in transcriptional silencing. This study suggests that PIAL1 and PIAl2 act as components of the MOM1-containing complex to mediate transcriptional silencing at heterochromatin regions.

PRJNA319318	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-seq of abscisic acid-reponsive transcription factors	"Abscisic acid (ABA) is an essential hormone that allows plants to respond to environmental stresses such as high salinity, drought and cold. It also plays a pivotal role in seed maturation and germination. Because of its importance, transcriptome changes in response to ABA have been profiled extensively by the plant community.  Very few ChIP-chip/seq of ABA-related TFs have been reported to date. To fill the knowledge gap about how ABA works at the transcriptional level, we carried out ChIP-seq on 21 TFs from 11 different families using both mock- and ABA-treated conditions. Analyses of the resulting 122 ChIP-seq datasets identified 326,698 TF binding events using a stringent statistical cutoff. Based on our data, a comprehensive regulatory network in Arabidopsis thaliana was constructed. We uncovered determinants of dynamic TF binding and defined a hierarchy among TFs to explain differential gene expression and pathway feedback regulation. By extrapolating regulatory characteristics observed for the canonical ABA pathway components, we identified a new family of transcriptional regulators modulating ABA and salt responsiveness, and demonstrate their utility to modulate plant resilience to osmotic stress.

Using transgenic Arabidopsis plants in Col-0 eds1-2 pad4-1 background conditionally expressing PAD4 and constitutively expressing EDS1 (ED-P4E1), an EDS1/PAD4 immune response can be triggered by estradiol treatment and can induce expression of defense-related genes and lead to enhanced basal resistance.

Physical genome maps for nine of the most diverse accessions revealed how transposable elements and other structural variations shaped the epigenome to allow rapid adaptation to environmental changes, with strong emphasis on disease resistance.

Shade enhances the activity of Phytochrome Interacting Factors (PIFs) by releasing those bHLH transcription factors from phytochrome B-mediated inhibition. PIFs promote elongation by inducing auxin production in cotyledons. In order to elucidate spatiotemporal aspects of the neighbor proximity response, we analyzed changes in transcript abundance at different time points during a shade treatment in dissected cotyledons and hypocotyls. We concentrated our analysis on these two organs because the former is considered as the primary shade-sensing organ while elongation is rapidly triggered in the hypocotyl. We conclude that PIFs initiate transcriptional reprogramming in both organs within 15 minutes comprising regulated expression of several early auxin response genes. This suggests that hypocotyl growth is elicited by both local and distal auxin signals. With time the transcriptional response diverges increasingly between organs. We identify genes whose differential expression may underlie organ-specific elongation. Finally, we uncover a growth promotion gene expression signature shared between responses to different environments and organs.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana Col-0 was grown for 5 days in a 16 h : 8 h, light : dark photoperiod at 21°C on one horizontal plate of c. 140 mm in diameter per sample. Each plate contained 25 ml ½ MS medium covered with a nylon mesh. On day 6 at ZT2, seedlings were either kept in high R/FR or transferred to low R/FR.

We have combined fluorescence-activated cell sorting and RNA-seq to characterise the cell-type-specific transcriptome at the earliest developmental time-point of lateral organ formation using DORNRÖSCHEN-LIKE::GFP to mark founder-cell populations at the periphery of the inflorescence meristem (IM) in apetala1 cauliflower double mutants, which overproliferate IMs. Within these founder-cells, floral primordium identity genes are upregulated and stem-cell identity markers are downregulated. The transcriptional network of differentially expressed genes supports the hypothesis that lateral organ founder-cell specification involves the creation of polarity from the centre to the periphery of the IM and the establishment of a boundary from surrounding cells, consistent with bract initiation. In contrast to the established paradigm that sites of auxin response maxima pre-pattern lateral organ initiation in the IM, only subtle transcriptional reprogramming within the global auxin network was observed, suggesting that auxin response might play a minor role in the earliest stages of lateral floral initiation.

Plants harboring a mutation in OVARIAN TUMOR DOMAIN-CONTAINING DEUBIQUITINATING ENZYME5 (OTU5) showed altered DNA methylation of root hair-related genes and altered Pi-responsive root traits. Unlike the wild type, homozygous otu5 mutants did not respond to Pi starvation by increased lateral root formation and increased root hair length but formed very short root hairs when grown on low-Pi media. Under Pi-replete conditions, otu5 plants developed more root hairs than the wild type due to attenuated primary root growth, a phenotype that resembled that of Pi-deficient plants. Growth of plants on low-Pi media altered both H3K4 and H3K27 trimethylation levels at the transcriptional start site of a subset of genes encoding key players in Pi homeostasis, which was correlated with mRNA abundance changes of these genes. Pi starvation had a minor impact on DNA methylation. Differentially methylated regions were enriched in transposable elements, suggesting that DNA methylation associated with low Pi supply is required for maintaining genome integrity. It is concluded that DNA methylation and histone methylation constitute critical, interdependent regulatory components that orchestrate the activity of a subset of Pi-responsive genes.
Overall design: To understand the role of OTU5 in root development and in the alterations in root developmental programs induced by Pi starvation, we performed a comprehensive assessment of the transcriptional profiles and DNA methylation patterns of the otu5 mutant and its wild type under control and Pi deficient-conditions.

Hybrid varieties usually exceed their parents in plant biomass and seed yield. The molecular basis of heterosis is not fully understood. In this project, we studied heterosis in Arabidopsis hybrids derived from crossing Ler and C24 accessions at early stages of seedling development. We found that early heterosis might be associated with non-additive gene expression that resulted from earlier changes in gene expression in the hybrids relative to the parents. The non-additively expressed genes are involved in metabolic pathways, including photosynthesis, critical for plant growth. The early up-regulation of genes involved in energy production in hybrids may be associated with heterosis in the young seedlings that could be essential for biomass heterosis at later developmental stages of the plant.

PRJNA322061	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)DNA N6-adenine methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (RNA)	"DNA methylation on N6-adenine (6mA), the most prevalent DNA modification in prokaryotes, has recently been found as a potentially new epigenetic mark in several unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the distribution patterns and potential functions of 6mA in land plants, which are primary producers for most ecosystems, remain completely unknown. Here we report global profiling of 6mA sites at single-nucleotide resolution in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0 (Col), using single-molecule real-time sequencing. DNA methylome analysis shows that 6mA sites are widely distributed across the Col genomes and enriched over the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. Nearly 30% of 6mA sites are present in gene bodies with a trend of enrichment around the transcriptional start site. In addition to a common consensus 6mA site found in other eukaryotes, novel 6mA sites were found, indicating that 6mA could evolve new functions in land plants. Further analysis of 6mA methylome and RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that 6mA positively correlates with the gene expression level in Col plants. Consistently, DNA affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry reveals that histone variants associated with actively expressed genes interact with 6mA DNA. Our results uncover 6mA as a DNA mark associated with actively expressed genes in Arabidopsis, indicating that 6mA could serve as a potentially novel epigenetic mark in land plants.

Most strikingly, 22 ntmiRNA isoformsand a set of 22 ntsiRNAs, were enriched in the membrane fraction and onMBPs, where they trigger phasedsecondary siRNAproduction from target transcripts.

PRJDB2938	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana RNA Seq	Genomes of higher eukaryotes, including plants, comprise a large amount of transposable elements (TEs), which are often silenced by epigenetic mechanisms such as histone posttranslational modifications and DNA methylation. Although silencing of TEs imposes deleterious effects on expression of nearby genes, recent studies reveal the presence of intragenic TEs marked by repressive epigenetic marks within actively transcribed genes. However, even for the well-studied plant model Arabidopsis thaliana, the abundance of intragenic TEs, how they are epigenetically regulated, and their potential impacts on host gene expression, remain unexplored. In this study, we comprehensively analyzed genome-wide distribution and epigenetic regulation of intragenic TEs in A.thaliana. Our analysis revealed that about 7% of TEs are located within gene bodies, almost equally distributed between intronic and exonic regions. Most of them are short and less methylated than their intergenic copies. Interestingly, while exonic TEs are epigenetically targeted in the same manner as genes, intronic TEs are regulated similarly to intergenic TEs. Moreover, expression analysis showed that heterochromatic epigenetic marks associated with intronic TEs are critical for proper transcription of the associated genes. Our study provides the first insight into how epigenetic regulation of intragenic TEs affects transcriptional landscape of the A.thaliana genome, and suggests the importance of epigenetic mechanisms for regulation of TEs within transcriptional gene units.

We generated an extensive catalog of nascent and steady state transcripts in Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings using global nuclear run-on sequencing (GRO-seq), 5'GRO-seq and RNA-seq and reanalyzed published maize data to capture the general characteristics of plant transcription. De novo annotation of nascent transcripts enabled accurate start site annotations and revealed novel unstable transcripts.  Coding and non-coding transcripts exhibit comparable promoter chromatin configurations. Motif analysis revealed new regulatory DNA elements including a conserved 'TGT core promoter motif' and unreported transcription factor (TF) binding sites. Mapping of engaged RNA polymerases revealed a lack of enhancer RNAs, promoter proximal pausing, and divergent transcription in Arabidopsis and maize, which are commonly present in humans and yeast. In contrast, Arabidopsis and maize genes accumulate RNA polymerases adjacent to the polyadenylation site immediately downstream of genes, a trend that correlated with increasing gene length and coincided with hypomethylation of CpG residues. Lack of promoter proximal pausing and a higher correlation of nascent and steady state transcripts indicates Arabidopsis regulates transcription predominantly at the level of initiation. Together, these findings provide insight into plant transcriptional mechanisms, but also eukaryotic transcription in general.

However, its molecular mode of action remains enigmatic. Here we demonstrate that nucleo-cytoplasmic LSD1 interacts with a broad range of other proteins that are engaged in various molecular pathways such as ubiquitination, methylation, cell cycle control, gametogenesis, embryo development and cell wall formation. The interaction of LSD1 with these partners is dependent on redox status, as oxidative stress significantly changes the quantity and types of LSD1-formed complexes. Furthermore, we show that LSD1 regulates the number and size of leaf mesophyll cells and affects plant vegetative growth. Importantly, we also reveal that in addition to its function as a scaffold protein, LSD1 acts as a transcriptional regulator. Taken together, our results demonstrate that LSD1 plays a dual role within the cell by acting as a condition-dependent scaffold protein and as a transcription regulator.

PRJNA322062	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)DNA N6-adenine methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana (methylation)	"DNA methylation on N6-adenine (6mA), the most prevalent DNA modification in prokaryotes, has recently been found as a potentially new epigenetic mark in several unicellular and multicellular eukaryotes. However, the distribution patterns and potential functions of 6mA in land plants, which are primary producers for most ecosystems, remain completely unknown. Here we report global profiling of 6mA sites at single-nucleotide resolution in the genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana Columbia-0 (Col), using single-molecule real-time sequencing. DNA methylome analysis shows that 6mA sites are widely distributed across the Col genomes and enriched over the pericentromeric heterochromatin regions. Nearly 30% of 6mA sites are present in gene bodies with a trend of enrichment around the transcriptional start site. In addition to a common consensus 6mA site found in other eukaryotes, novel 6mA sites were found, indicating that 6mA could evolve new functions in land plants. Further analysis of 6mA methylome and RNA-sequencing data demonstrates that 6mA positively correlates with the gene expression level in Col plants. Consistently, DNA affinity chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry reveals that histone variants associated with actively expressed genes interact with 6mA DNA. Our results uncover 6mA as a DNA mark associated with actively expressed genes in Arabidopsis, indicating that 6mA could serve as a potentially novel epigenetic mark in land plants.

Whole-genome oligonucleotide tiling microarrays were used for gene expression studies of the entire transcriptome for wildtype Col-0, abh1-1, ein5-6, and ein5-6 abh1-1 plants.
Micro (mi)RNAs and small-interfering (si)RNAs are abundant endogenous small (sm)RNAs that control transcript expression by post-transcriptional gene silencing. Here, we show that concomitant loss of XRN4/EIN5, a 5’-3’ exoribonuclease, and CBP80/ABH1, the largest subunit of the mRNA cap binding complex, results in Arabidopsis plants manifesting myriad developmental defects. Through the analysis of ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, we find that CBP80/ABH1 regulates the levels of mature miRNAs, which suggests this protein is a novel component of the miRNA-mediated RNA silencing pathway. Additionally, we show that a novel class of smRNAs are processed from both sense and anti-sense strands of ~130 endogenous transcripts that apparently are converted to double-stranded RNA and subsequently processed into smRNAs, and accumulate in the absence of XRN4/EIN5. Moreover, we demonstrate that accumulation of these smRNAs is often synergistically increased in ein5 abh1 double mutant plants, which suggests that these proteins act coordinately to regulate the substrates from which they are processed. Finally, we find that the parent transcripts of these novel smRNAs accumulate in an uncapped form upon loss of XRN4/EIN5. These results suggest that uncapped endogenous transcripts can shuttle into an RNA silencing pathway where they become smRNA biogenesis substrates. Overall, our results reveal unexpected connections between RNA metabolism and silencing.

Large-scale methylation changes accompany endosperm development and endosperm-specific gene expression. Transposable element fragments are extensively demethylated in the endosperm. We discovered new imprinted genes by identifying candidate genes associated with the top differentially methylated regions. Our data suggest that imprinting in plants evolved from genome defense against transposable elements.

The enzymes catalyzing DNA methylation and H3K9me2 have been identified and mutations in these proteins lead to the reactivation of silenced heterochromatic elements. The enzymes responsible for heterochromatic H3K27me1, in contrast, remain unknown. Here we show that the divergent SET-domain proteins ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5) and ATXR6 exhibit H3K27 monomethyltransferase activity and double mutants have reduced H3K27me1 in vivo and show partial heterochromatin decondensation. atxr5 atxr6 plants also show transcriptional activation of repressed heterochromatic elements. Interestingly, H3K9me2 and DNA methylation are unaffected in the double mutant. These results indicate that ATXR5 and ATXR6 form a novel class of H3K27 methyltransferases and that H3K27me1 represents a new pathway required for transcriptional repression in Arabidopsis.

"DNA methylation is essential for silencing transposable elements and some genes in higher eukaryotes, implying that this modification must be tightly controlled. However, accidental changes in DNA methylation can be transmitted through mitosis, as in cancer, or meiosis, leading to epiallelic variation. Here, we demonstrate the existence of an efficient and faithful mechanism that protects against transgenerational loss of DNA methylation in the plant Arabidopsis. This process is specific to the subset of heavily methylated genomic repeats that are targeted by the RNAi machinery, and does not spread into flanking regions. Remethylation is often progressive over two to four sexual generations. This differential and incremental correction of epigenetic defects may preserve genome stability while increasing adaptive opportunities.

Low-oxygen stress resulted in changes to the abundance of 46 miRNAs from 19 families, and all 3 tasiRNA families. Chemical inhibition of mitochondrial respiration caused similar changes in expression in a majority of the low-oxygen responsive small RNAs analysed.

PRJNA118371	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Uncovering small RNA-mediated responses to phosphate-deficiency in Arabidopsis by deep sequencing	"Deep sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana small RNAs was conducted to reveal microRNAs (miRNAs) and other small RNAs that were differentially expressed in response to phosphate (Pi) deficiency. About 3.5 million sequence reads corresponding to 0.6-1.2 million unique sequence tags from each Pi-sufficient or -deficient root or shoot sample were mapped to the Arabidopsis genome. We showed that upon Pi deprivation, the expression of miR156, miR399, miR778 and miR827 was induced, whereas the expression of miR169, miR395 and miR398 was repressed. We found crosstalks coordinated by these miRNAs under different nutrient deficiencies. Moreover, we found a new miRNA family upregulated specifically by Pi deficiency. In addition to miRNAs, we identified one Pi starvation-induced DCL1-dependent small RNA derived from the long terminal repeat of a retrotransposon and a group of 19-nucleotide small RNAs corresponding to the 5' end of tRNA and expressed at a high level in Pi-starved roots. Interestingly, we observed an increased abundance of TAS4-derived trans-acting siRNAs (ta-siRNAs) in Pi-deficient shoots and uncovered an autoregulatory mechanism of PAP1/MYB75 via miR828 and TAS4-siR81(-) that regulates the biosynthesis of anthocyanin. This finding sheds light on the regulatory network between miRNA/ta-siRNA and its target gene. Of note, a substantial amount of miR399* accumulated under Pi deficiency. Like miR399, miR399* can move across the graft junction, implying a potential biological role for miR399*. This study represents a comprehensive expression profiling of Pi-responsive small RNAs and advances our understanding of the regulation of Pi homeostasis mediated by small RNAs.

RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in plants requires two RNA polymerase II (PolII)-related RNA polymerases named PolIV and PolV. A genetic screen designed to reveal factors important for RdDM in a developmental context in Arabidopsis identified DEFECTIVE IN MERISTEM SILENCING 4 (DMS4). Unlike other mutants defective in RdDM, dms4 mutants have a pleiotropic developmental phenotype.DMS4 is similar to yeast IWR1, a conserved putative transcription factor that interacts with PolII subunits. In the transgenic system studied, mutations in DMS4 directly or indirectly affect PolIV-dependent secondary siRNAs, PolV-mediated RdDM, PolV-dependent synthesis of intergenic noncoding RNA, and expression of many PolII-driven genes. These data suggest that DMS4 may be a regulatory factor for multiple RNA polymerases, thus explaining its diverse roles in the plant.

While DNA methylation likely has a conserved role in gene silencing, the levels and patterns of DNA methylation appear to vary drastically among different organisms. Here, we used shotgun genomic bisulfite sequencing (BS-Seq) to compare DNA methylation in eight diverse plant and animal genomes. We found that patterns of methylation are very similar in flowering plants with methylated cytosines detected in all sequence contexts, whereas CG methylation predominates in animals. Vertebrates have methylation throughout the genome except for CpG islands. Gene body methylation is conserved with clear preference for exons in most of the organisms. Furthermore, genes appear to be the major target of methylation in Ciona and honeybee. Among the eight organisms, the green alga Chlamydomonas has the most unusual pattern of methylation, having non-CG methylation enriched in exons of genes rather than in repeats and transposons. In addition, we demonstrate that the Dnmt1 cofactor Uhrf1 has a conserved function in maintaining CG methylation in both transposons and gene bodies in the mouse, Arabidopsis, and zebrafish genomes.

Origins of replication are the genomic sites where DNA replication initiates in every cell cycle. There are multiple origins scattered throughout the eukaryotic genome whose genome-wide identification has been a hard challenge, especially in multicellular organisms. Thus, very little is known on the distinctive features of origins in terms of DNA sequence and chromatin context at a genomic scale. Here we have profiled origins in Arabidopsis thaliana by high-throughput sequencing of purified nascent DNA strands. We have identified 1543 replication origins, which were uniformly distributed across the Arabidopsis genome and enriched in binding signals of two replication initiation proteins, CDC6 and ORC1. We have also analyzed novel epigenome maps of various histone modifications and found links between origins and epigenetic signatures, which differ from or have not been reported for other eukaryotic systems. Arabidopsis origins tend to be embedded in G+C-rich regions within the 5’ half of genes, enriched in histone H2A.Z, H3K4me2/3 and acetylated H3 and H4, and depleted of H3K4me1 and H3K9me2.

Our comprehensive analysis of paired RNAs reveals conserved functionality within introns and both 5’ and 3’ untranslated regions (UTRs) of mRNAs, as well as a novel population of functional RNAs, many of which are the precursors of smRNAs. Finally, we identify intra-molecular base-pairing interactions to produce a genome-wide collection of RNA secondary structure models. These findings highlight the importance of base-paired RNAs in eukaryotes, and present an approach that should be widely applicable for the analysis of this key structural feature of RNA.

PRJNA132535	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Extensive imprinted gene expression in Arabidopsis endosperm	"Some flowering plant and vertebrate genes are expressed primarily or exclusively from either the maternal or paternal allele, a phenomenon called genomic imprinting. Flowering plant imprinted gene expression has been described primarily in endosperm, a terminal nutritive tissue consumed by the embryo during seed development or after germination. Imprinted expression in Arabidopsis thaliana endosperm is orchestrated by differences in cytosine DNA methylation between the paternal and maternal genomes, as well as by Polycomb group (PcG) proteins. Currently only eleven imprinted Arabidopsis genes are known. Here we use extensive sequencing of cDNA libraries to identify many new paternally and maternally imprinted genes in A. thaliana endosperm, including transcription factors, proteins involved in hormone signaling, and epigenetic regulators. The imprinted status of many maternally-expressed genes is not altered by mutations in the DNA-demethylating glycosylase DEMETER, the DNA methyltransferase MET1 or the core PcG protein FIE, indicating that these genes are regulated by novel mechanisms or deposited from maternal tissues. We did not find any imprinted genes in the embryo. Our results demonstrate that imprinted gene expression, particularly from the maternal genome, is an extensive, mechanistically complex phenomenon that likely affects multiple aspects of seed development.

PRJNA132271	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)RNA-seq of Arabidopsis spl7 identifies two genes required for copper acquisition and a copper dependence of iron homeostasis	"The transition metal copper (Cu) is an essential element for all living organisms. In plants, Cu plays key roles in electron transport chains of chloroplasts and mitochondria, as well as in cell wall metabolism, ethylene perception, molybdenum cofactor synthesis and oxidative stress protection. Because of its physiological importance, suboptimal concentrations of Cu trigger a re-organization of metabolism to economize on Cu, and pronounced Cu deficiency causes severe growth reduction and defects in male fertility. However, when present in excess, Cu can be highly toxic. Therefore, Cu uptake, utilization and cellular concentrations are strictly regulated. A number of components of the Cu-homeostatic network of Arabidopsis have already been identified. However, the mechanisms that control responses of plant gene expression to Cu-deficiency are only partly understood. In Chlamydomonas reinhardtii, the transcription factor Crr1 is required for activating and/or repressing the expression of a number of genes in response to Cu deficiency. This protein contains a plant-specific DNA-binding domain (SBP domain), ankyrin repeats and a C-terminal cysteine-rich region with similarity to a Drosophila metallothionein (MT). In Arabidopsis, there is a family of 16 proteins with SBP domains named SPL family (SBP-like) of which a subset of proteins have been implicated in flowering time control and floral development. Among all of them, AtSPL7 is the most similar to Crr1 (27 % identity), and AtSPL1 (25 % identity), AtSPL12 (24 % identity) and AtSPL14 (23 % identity) share a common protein architecture. The goal of this work was to obtain a complete account of the response of the Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptome to Cu deficiency, as well as  to determine the role of AtSPL7 in the transcriptional response to Cu deficiency. For this purpose, three independent experiments were carried out including Col-0 wild-type and spl7-2 mutant plants grown in Cu-sufficient and Cu-deficient hydroponic media, respectively. Root and shoot transcriptomes were established by RNA-Seq for quantitative comparisons.
Overall design: Sampling of root and shoot tissues of wild-type (WT, Col-0) and spl7-2 mutant plants (the mutant is knock-down for the transcription factor SPL7, which plays a key role in the transcriptional regulation of the copper deficiency responses) cultivated hydroponically in a modified Hoagland's solution under Cu-sufficient (control) and Cu-deficient conditions.

PRJNA133457	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide mapping of the HY5-mediated gene networks in Arabidopsis that involve both transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulations: RNA-Seq	"LONG HYPOCOTYL 5 (HY5) is a basic leucine zipper transcription factor (TF) that functions downstream of multiple families of photoreceptors. Mutations in the HY5 gene cause a myriad of aberrant phenotypes in Arabidopsis, including elongated hypocotyl, reduced accumulation of pigments, halted chloroplast development in greening hypocotyls, altered root morphology and defective hormonal and stimulus responses. HY5 thus acts as an integrater that links various gene networks to coordinate plant development. Here we report an effort to experimentally map the HY5-mediated gene networks in Arabidopsis by integrating genomic loci occupied by HY5 and HY5-dependent gene expression profiles. Our results indicate HY5 binds to over 9,000 genes, which detectably impact the expression of over 1,100 genes, either positively or negatively. Further, HY5 indirectly regulates many other genes through sub-networks mediated by other regulators. In particular, we show that HY5 regulates eight microRNA (miRNA) genes, which in turn control transcript abundance of specific target genes. Over-expressing the HY5-targeted miR408 resulted in phenotypes that are opposite to hy5 mutants. Together our results revealed both the transcriptional and post-transcriptional components of the HY5-mediated gene networks responsible for the phenotypic complexity in plants.

PRJNA79813	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Homoeolog-specific retention and use in allotetraploid Arabidopsis suecica depends on parent of origin and network partners	Allotetraploids carry pairs of diverged homoeologs for most genes. With the genome doubled in size, the number of putative interactions is enormous. This poses challenges on how to coordinate the two disparate genomes, and creates opportunities by enhancing the phenotypic variation. New combinations of alleles co-adapt and respond to new environmental pressures. Three stages of the allopolyploidization process - parental species divergence, hybridization, and genome duplication - have been well analyzed. The last stage of evolutionary adjustments remains mysterious. Homoeolog-specific retention and use were analyzed in Arabidopsis suecica (As), a species derived from A. thaliana (At) and A. arenosa (Aa) in a single event 12-300KYA. 405,466 diagnostic features on tiling microarrays were used to recognize At and Aa contributions to the As genome and transcriptome. 324 genes lacked Aa contributions and 614 genes lacked At contributions within As. In leaf tissues, 3,458 genes preferentially expressed At homoeologs while 4,150 favored Aa homoeologs. These patterns were validated with resequencing. Genes with preferential use of Aa homoeologs were enriched for expression functions, consistent with the dominance of Aa transcription. Heterologous networks - mixed from At and Aa transcripts - were underrepresented. Thousands of deleted and silenced homoeologs in the genome of As were identified. Since heterologous networks may be compromised by interspecies incompatibilities, these networks evolve co-biases, expressing either only Aa or only At homoeologs. This progressive change towards predominantly pure parental networks might contribute to phenotypic variability and plasticity, and enable the species to exploit a larger range of environments.

PRJNA134821	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Maternal siRNAs as regulators of parental genome imbalance and gene expression in endosperm of Arabidopsis seeds.	"Seed size is important to crop domestication and natural selection and is affected by the balance of maternal and paternal genomes in endosperm. Endosperm, like placenta in mammals, provides reserves to the developing embryo. Interploidy crosses disrupt the genome balance in endosperm and alter seed size. Specifically, paternal-excess crosses (2 × 4) delay endosperm cellularization (EC) and produce larger seeds, whereas maternal-excess crosses (4 × 2) promote precocious EC and produce smaller seeds. The mechanisms for responding to the parental genome dosage imbalance and for gene expression changes in endosperm are unknown. In plants, RNA polymerase IV (PolIV or p4) encoded by NRPD1a is required for biogenesis of a major class of 24-nt small interfering RNAs (also known as p4-siRNAs), which are predominately expressed in developing endosperm. Here we show that p4-siRNA accumulation depends on the maternal genome dosage, and maternal p4-siRNAs target transposable elements (TEs) and TE-associated genes (TAGs) in seeds. The p4-siRNAs correlate negatively with expression levels of AGAMOUS-LIKE (AGL) genes in endosperm of interploidy crosses. Moreover, disruption of maternal NRPD1a expression is associated with p4-siRNA reduction and AGL up-regulation in endosperm of reciprocal crosses. This is unique genetic evidence for maternal siRNAs in response to parental genome imbalance and in control of transposons and gene expression during endosperm development.

Presumably the patterning defects observed in dcl1-5 null embryos are due to the loss of miRNAs and the consequent up-regulation of their respective targets. To test which miRNA targets were up-regulated in dcl1 embryos relative to wild-type embryos, we performed genome-wide transcript profiling of wild-type and dcl1-5 early globular embryos using directional mRNA-Seq.
Overall design: For RNA isolation, pools of 30 Col-0 (wild-type) and dcl1-5 early globular embryos were hand-dissected in water, immediately transferred to 30 ul of RNAlater (Ambion), incubated at 60° C with 500 ul TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) for 30 minutes, and then purified according to the TRIzol Reagent protocol for RNA isolation from small quantities of tissue (Invitrogen). Two rounds of linear amplification of poly(A) RNA were performed using the Arcturus RiboAmp HS Plus kit (Molecular Devices). Strand-specific mRNA-Seq libraries were generated as previously described (Guo et al., Nature, 2010). After removing adaptor sequences, sequences were mapped to the Arabidopsis thaliana genome (TAIR9 assembly) using the Bowtie short read aligner allowing up to two mismatches within a 25 nt ‘seed’ sequence and retaining reads mapping uniquely to the genome. Since the Arcuturus RiboAmp HS Plus kit generates amplified RNAs in the antisense orientation, reads were counted as matching TAIR9 annotated genes if they overlapped the antisense strand. Less..."

Defining the contributions and interactions of paternal and maternal genomes during embryo development is critical to understand the fundamental processes involved in hybrid vigor, hybrid sterility, and reproductive isolation. To determine the parental contributions and their regulation during Arabidopsis embryogenesis we combined deep-sequencing-based RNA profiling and genetic analyses. At the 2-4 cell stage there is a strong, genome-wide dominance of maternal transcripts, although transcripts are contributed by both parental genomes. At the globular stage the relative paternal contribution is higher, largely due to a gradual activation of the paternal genome. We identified two antagonistic maternal pathways that control these parental contributions. Paternal alleles are initially down-regulated by the chromatin siRNA pathway, linked to DNA and histone methylation, while transcriptional activation requires maternal activity of the histone chaperone complex CAF1. Our results define maternal epigenetic pathways controlling the parental contributions in plant embryos, which are distinct from those regulating genomic imprinting.

Here, we reported that we identified 5 new alleles of DCL1 which are able to suppress the hyl1 morphological phenotypes and restore the miRNA accumulation level in hyl1 plants. These new alleles are located in the helicase and RNaseIIIa domains of DCL1, highlighting the critical functions of these domains. Biochemical analyses of these suppressors indicated that they process pri-miRNA more efficiently, with both higher Kcat and lower Km values. In addition, we investigated the functions of the DCL1 helicase domain. Our results indicated that the helicase domain is able to modulate the DCL1 processing activities. Based on these results, we proposed that HYL1 might exert its function through interaction with the DCL1 helicase domain.  Small RNA sequencing from hyl1 and select hyl1/dcl1 suppressor mutants confirms thats suppression of the hyl1 phenotype is due to an increase in the accumulation, but not the precision, of miRNAs in the suppressor mutants.

RNA-seq data were analyzed with a newly developed software package, RACKJ (Read Analysis & Comparison Kit in Java). Subsets of 460 and 1480 genes were found to be either differentially expressed or affected in their splicing patterns upon iron deficiency. The two groups showed a small, random overlap, indicating that alternative splicing and differential gene expression represent parallel, but potentially interacting regulatory mechanisms. The majority (~95%) of the context-sensitive alternative splicing events was due to differentially retained introns. Intron retention was mostly repressed in iron-deficient plants, while exon skipping did not show a clear trend in either direction. A comparison with a similar data set for phosphate-deficient plants supported stress-repressed intron retention and revealed nutrient-specific changes of splicing patterns. It is concluded that iron and phosphate deficiency increases splicing fidelity for a subset of transcripts, probably as a means of acclimation to nutrient shortage. Less...

PRJNA147225	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)SKIP Is a Component of the Spliceosome Linking Alternative Splicing and the Circadian Clock in Arabidopsis	"Circadian clocks generate endogenous rhythms in most organisms from cyanobacteria to humans and facilitate entrainment to environmental diurnal cycles, thus conferring a fitness advantage. Both transcriptional and posttranslational mechanisms are prominent in the basic network architecture of circadian systems. Posttranscriptional regulation, including mRNA processing, is emerging as a critical step for the clock function. However, little is known about the molecular mechanisms linking RNA metabolism to the circadian clock network. Here we report that a conserved SNW/SKIP domain protein, SKIP, a splicing factor and component of the spliceosome, is involved in the posttranscriptional regulation of circadian clock genes in Arabidopsis. Mutation in SKIP lengthens the circadian period in a temperature sensitive manner, affects light input and the sensitivity of light resetting to the clock. SKIP physically interacts with the spliceosomal splicing factor SR45 and associates with the pre-mRNA of clock genes, such as PRR7 and PRR9, and is necessary for the regulation of their alternative splicing and mRNA maturation. Genome-wide investigations reveal that SKIP functions in regulating alternative splicing of many genes, presumably through modulating recognition or cleavage of 5' and 3' splicing site. Our study addresses a fundamental question on how the mRNA splicing machinery contributes to circadian clock functions at a posttranscriptional level.
Overall design: Our findings revealed that AtSKIP is a splicing factor and a component of spliceosome. To further investigate effects of mutation in SKIP on the genome-wide changes of alternative splicing, we performed ultra-highthroughput RNA sequencing, using 10-day old seedlings.

PRJNA146353	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)IBM1, a JmjC domain histone demethylase, is involved in the regulation of RNA-directed DNA methylation through epigenetic control of RDR2 and DCL3 expression in Arabidopsis.	"The small RNA mediated DNA methylation (RdDM) is highly elaborated in Arabidopsis as an important epigenetic pathway controls expression of genes and multiple developmental processes. RDR2 and DCL3 are necessary factors to the 24-nt siRNA biogenesis and the RdDM pathway. Here, we find that IBM1 (increase in BONSAI methylation 1), a conserved JmjC family histone demethylase, could directly associated with the chromatin of RDR2 and DCL3. The IBM1 mutation induces hypermethylation on both H3K9 and DNA non-CG sites in these loci, and further represses their expression. The reduction of RDR2 and DCL3 may affect siRNA biogenesis in a locus-specific manner and disrupt the RdDM directed repression. It suggests an indirect way to regulate targets by IBM1 through control of siRNA biogenesis, and demonstrate the relationship between histone methylation and small RNAs.

PRJNA80171	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Unexpected diversity of chloroplast non-coding RNAs as revealed by deep sequencing of the Arabidopsis transcriptome	Non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) are widely expressed in both prokaryotes and eukaryotes. Eukaryotic ncRNAs are commonly small (18-25 nt) micro- and small interfering RNAs involved in post-transcriptional gene silencing, while prokaryotic ncRNAs vary in size and are involved in various aspects of gene regulation. Given the prokaryotic origin of organelles, the presence of ncRNAs might be expected, however, the full spectrum of organellar ncRNAs has not been determined systematically. Here, strand-specific RNA-Seq analysis was used to identify 107 candidate ncRNAs from Arabidopsis thaliana chloroplasts, primarily encoded opposite protein- coding and tRNA genes. Forty-eight ncRNAs were shown to accumulate by RNA gel blot as discrete transcripts in wild-type (WT) plants and/or the pnp1-1 mutant, which lacks the chloroplast ribonuclease polynucleotide phosphorylase (cpPNPase). Ninety-eight percent of the ncRNAs detected by RNA gel blot had different transcript patterns between WT and pnp1-1, suggesting cpPNPase has a significant role in chloroplast ncRNA biogenesis and accumulation. Analysis of materials deficient for other major chloroplast ribonucleases, RNase R, RNase E and RNase J, showed differential effects on ncRNA accumulation and/or form, suggesting specificity in RNase-ncRNA interactions. 5' end mapping showed that some ncRNAs are transcribed from dedicated promoters, while others result from transcriptional read-through. Finally, correlations between accumulation of some ncRNAs and the symmetrically-transcribed sense RNA are consistent with a role in RNA stability. Overall, our data suggest that this extensive population of ncRNAs has the potential to underpin a previously underappreciated regulatory mode in the chloroplast. Less...	
PRJNA146493	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Natural variation in processability of individual Arabidopsis thaliana microRNAs	"Like protein coding genes, loci that produce microRNAs (miRNAs) are generally considered to be under purifying selection, consistent with miRNA polymorphisms being able to cause disease. Nevertheless, it has been hypothesized that variation in miRNA genes may contribute to phenotypic diversity. Here we demonstrate that a naturally occurring polymorphism in the MIR164A gene interacts epistatically with an unlinked locus to affect leaf shape and shoot architecture in Arabidopsis thaliana. A single-base pair substitution in the miRNA complementary sequence alters the stability of the miRNA:miRNA* duplex. It thereby interferes with processing of the precursor and greatly reduces miRNA accumulation. We demonstrate that this is not a rare exception, but that natural strains of Arabidopsis thaliana harbor dozens of similar polymorphisms that affect processing of a wide range of miRNA precursors. Our results suggest that natural variation in miRNA processability due to cis mutations is a common contributor to phenotypic variation in plants.

PRJEB2678	Spontaneous epigenetic variation in the Arabidopsis thaliana methylome	Heritable epigenetic polymorphisms, such as differential cytosine methylation, can underlie phenotypic variation. Moreover, wild strains of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana differ in many epialleles3,4, and these can influence the expression of nearby genes. However, to understand their role in evolution, it is imperative to ascertain the emergence rate and stability of epialleles, including those that are not due to structural variation. We have compared genome-wide DNA methylation among 10 A. thaliana lines, derived 30 generations ago from a common ancestor. Epimutations at individual positions were easily detected, and close to 30,000 cytosines in each strain were differentially methylated. In contrast, larger regions of contiguous methylation were much more stable, and the frequency of changes was in the same low range as that of DNA mutations. Like individual positions, the same regions were often affected by differential methylation in independent lines, with evidence for recurrent cycles of forward and reverse mutations. Transposable elements (TEs) and short interfering RNAs (siRNAs) have been causally linked to DNA methylation. In agreement, differentially methylated sites were farther from TEs and showed less association with siRNA expression than invariant positions. The biased distribution and frequent reversion of epimutations have important implications for the potential contribution of sequence-independent epialleles to plant evolution. Less...	
PRJNA148475	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Maternal and paternal genomes contribute equally to the transcriptome of early plant embryos	"In animals, maternal gene products deposited into eggs regulate embryonic development before activation of the zygotic genome. In plants, an analogous period of prolonged maternal control over embryogenesis is thought to occur based on gene-expression studies. However, other gene-expression studies and genetic analyses show that some transcripts must derive from the early zygotic genome, implying that the prevailing model does not fully explain the nature of zygotic genome activation in plants. To determine the maternal, paternal and zygotic contributions to the early embryonic transcriptome, we sequenced the transcripts of hybrid embryos from crosses between two polymorphic inbred lines of Arabidopsis thaliana and used single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) diagnostic of each parental line to quantify parental contributions. Although some transcripts appeared to be either inherited from primarily one parent or transcribed from imprinted embryonic loci, the vast majority of transcripts were produced in near-equal amounts from both maternal and paternal alleles, even during the initial stages of embryogenesis. Results of reporter experiments and analyses of transcripts from genes that are not expressed in sperm and egg indicate early and widespread zygotic transcription. Thus, in contrast to early animal embryogenesis, early plant embryogenesis is mostly under zygotic control.
Overall design: Col-0 and Cvi-0 seed stocks were obtained from the Arabidopsis Biological Resource Center. Plants were grown at 22° C in a Conviron growth chamber with a 16-h light/8-h dark cycle. Flowers were emasculated one day before crossing, and pools of twenty 1-cell/2-cell, 8-cell and ~32-cell embryos were hand-dissected approximately 40, 64 and 78 hours after pollination, respectively. Embryo dissections, RNA isolation, linear amplification of poly(A) RNA and strand-specific RNA-Seq was as described (Nodine and Bartel, 2010, Genes & Development), except that embryos were extensively washed prior to RNA isolation. After removing adaptor sequences, reads were mapped to both the A. thaliana genome and transcript models (Col-0 genome reference, TAIR10) with the Bowtie short-read aligner. Reads were also mapped to a ‘pseudo’ Cvi-0 genome and Cvi-0 transcript models, in which SNPs in the Col-0 genome and transcript models were replaced with Cvi-0 variants (ftp://ftp.arabidopsis.org/home/tair/Sequences/Ecker_Cvi_snps.txt) generated by the 1,001 Genomes Project. Reads that both perfectly and uniquely matched either the genomes or transcript models were retained, and those overlapping transcribed regions of annotated genes were evaluated for overlap with SNPs. To normalize for differences in library sizes, the numbers of reads representing each transcript were divided by the total number of reads matching the genome and transcript models. SNP-overlapping reads were assigned to one of the parental genomes and tallied for each transcript, combining tallies for multiple SNPs within the same transcript. Less..."

PRJNA149671	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Atypical DNA methylation of genes encoding cysteine-rich peptides in Arabidopsis thaliana	"In plants, transposons and non-protein-coding repeats are epigenetically silenced by CG and non-CG methylation. This pattern of methylation is mediated in part by small RNAs and two specialized RNA polymerases, Pol IV and Pol V, in a process called RNA-directed DNA methylation.  By contrast, many protein-coding genes transcribed by Pol II contain in their gene bodies exclusively CG methylation that is independent of small RNAs and Pol IV/Pol V activities. It is unclear how the different methylation machineries distinguish between transposons and genes. Here we report on a group of atypical genes that display in their coding region a transposon-like methylation pattern, which is associated with gene silencing in sporophytic tissues.

One common characteristic of the genomic regions associated with regulatory proteins is a pronounced sensitivity to DNase I digestion.  We reported genome-wide high resolution maps of DNase I hypersensitive (DH) sites from both seedling and flower tissues of Arabidopsis from the Columbia (Col) ecotype and the corresponding ddm1 (deficient in DNA methylation 1) mutant. We identified 38,290, 41,193, 38,313, and 38,153 DH sites in leaf (Col), flower (Col), ddm1 leaf, and ddm1 flower tissues, respectively. Approximately 45% of the DH sites in all tissue types were located within 1 kb of a transcription start site (TSS), which represents a putative promoter region. Pairwise comparisons of the DH sites derived from different tissue types revealed DH sites specific to each tissue. DH sites are significantly associated with long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs) and conserved non-coding sequences (CNSs). The binding sites of MADS-domain transcription factors AP1 and SEP3 are highly correlated with DH sites.

Both hybrids displayed increased DNA methylation across their entire genomes, especially in transposable elements.  Interestingly, we found that increased methylation of the hybrid genomes predominantly occurred in regions that were differentially methylated in the two parents and covered by small RNAs (sRNAs), implying that the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway may direct DNA methylation in hybrids.

Histone H3 has two main variants, H3.1 and H3.3, which show different genomic localization patterns in animals. We profiled H3.1 and H3.3 variants in the genome of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana and show that the localization of these variants shows broad similarity in plants and animals, in addition to some unique features. H3.1 was enriched in silent areas of the genome including regions containing the repressive chromatin modifications H3 lysine 27 methylation, H3 lysine 9 methylation, and DNA methylation. In contrast, H3.3 was enriched in actively transcribed genes, especially peaking at the 3’ end of genes, and correlated with histone modifications associated with gene activation such as histone H3 lysine 4 methylation, and H2B ubiquitylation, as well as by RNA Pol II occupancy. Surprisingly, both H3.1 and H3.3 were enriched on defined origins of replication, as was overall nucleosome density, suggesting a novel characteristic of plant origins. Our results are broadly consistent with the hypothesis that H3.1 acts as the canonical histone that is incorporated during DNA replication, whereas H3.3 acts as the replacement histone that can be incorporated outside of S-phase during chromatin disrupting processes like transcription.

Expression of HAE and HSL2 is specific to Abscission Zone (AZ) cells and is higher in stage 15 flowers than in earlier developmental stages. By stage 16 floral organs have begun to abscise, suggesting that HAE HSL2 are most active in stage 15 flowers. Samples were enriched for AZ RNA by isolating RNA from flower receptacles, the region from the base of the flower to slightly above the base of attachment of the sepals, petals, and stamen. RNA-seq was then used to analyze and compare the transcriptomes of wild type and hae-3 hsl2-3 mutants. 2034 genes were differentially expressed with a False Discovery Rate adjusted p < 0.05, of which 349 genes 2 fold or greater change. Of these 349, 277 were lower in the mutant and 72 were higher. Differentially expressed genes with lower expression were enriched for hydrolytic enzymes, cell-wall modifying enzymes, and defense related genes. This suggests that HAE HSL2 signaling regulates gene expression of enzymes necessary for abscission.

Here we show that BR and GA act interdependently through a direct interaction between the BR-activated BZR1 and GAinactivated DELLA transcription regulators. GA promotion of cell elongation required BR signaling, whereas BR or active BZR1 can suppresssed the GA-deficient dwarf phenotype. DELLAs directly interacted with BZR1 and inhibited BZR1-DNA binding both in vitro and in vivo. Genome-wide analysis defined a BZR1-dependent GA-regulated transcriptome, which is enriched with light-regulated genes and genes involved in cell wall synthesis and photosynthesis/chloroplast. GA promotion of hypocotyl elongation requires both BZR1 and the phytochrome interacting factors (PIFs), as well as their common downstream targets PREs. The results demonstrate that GA releases DELLA-mediated inhibition of BZR1, and that the DELLA-BZR1-PIF4 interaction defines a core transcription module that mediates coordinated growth regulation by GA, BR and light signals.

PRJNA152685	Differentiated Truncation and Uridylation Patterns of miRNAs in Arabidopsis and Rice hen1 Mutants Suggest miRNAs May Re-program RISC	"miRNA levels depend on both biogenesis and turnover. The methyltransferase HEN1 stabilizes plant miRNAs, animal piRNAs, and siRNAs in both kingdoms via 3' terminal methylation. Loss of HEN1 in plants results in non-templated oligo-uridylation and accelerated degradation of miRNAs. In hen1 mutants from Arabidopsis and rice, we found that the patterns of miRNA truncation and uridylation differ substantially among miRNA families, but such patterns for the same miRNA are conserved between species. miR166 and miR163 are truncated predominantly to ~17 and ~16 nt, and subsequently recover via uridylation to approximately their original sizes, 21 and 24 nt, suggesting that in these cases miRNA truncation triggers uridylation. miR171 is untruncated but uridylated to 22 nt in hen1 mutants, gaining the ability to trigger production of phased, secondary siRNAs. Truncated and tailed variants were bound by ARGONAUTE1 (AGO1) in hen1, implying that these events occur while miRNAs are still bound by AGO1. Unexpectedly, a portion of miR158 in wildtype remains unmethylated and thus subject to uridylation and destabilization, suggesting that plants naturally utilize miRNA methylation to modulate miRNA accumulation. Our results suggest that the AGO1-containing RISC complex may undergo programming to reflect each bound miRNA, determining a defined, distinct decay destiny.
Overall design: In this analysis, we sequenced sRNAs from two hen1 mutant alleles in Arabidopsis and three hen1 alleles in rice. In Arabidopsis, the strong hen1-1 allele in the Landsberg erecta (Ler) ecotype is the first hen1 mutant and emerged from an enhancer screen in the hua1-1/hua2-1 background, and hen1-8 in the Columbia (Col) background is a weak allele. In rice, WAVY LEAF1 (WAF1) is the ortholog of Arabidopsis HEN1, and two mutant alleles waf1-1 and waf1-2 each bear a single-base substitution leading to a premature stop codon in the second exon and a non-functional splicing site of the fourth intron, respectively. We identified a third mutant allele of the rice HEN1 gene (Oshen1-3 from the Korean (POSTEC) rice T-DNA mutant population). Less..."

We named them diRNAs for DSB-induced small RNAs. In Arabidopsis, the biogenesis of diRNAs requires the PI3 kinase ATR, RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV), and Dicer-like proteins. Mutations in these proteins as well as in Pol V cause significant reduction in DSB repair efficiency. diRNAs are recruited by Argonaute 2 (AGO2) to mediate DSB repair. In humans, knocking down Dicer or Ago2 causes a significant reduction in DSB repair. Our findings reveal a novel biological function for small RNAs in the DSB repair pathway. We propose that diRNAs may function as guide molecules for chromatin modifications or recruitment of repair complexes at DSB sites to facilitate repair.

PRJNA153225	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Characterization of small RNA-generating regions targeted by RNA polymerase V in Arabidopsis	"In plants, heterochromatin is maintained by a small RNA-based gene silencing mechanism known as RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM). RdDM requires the non-redundant functions of two plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerases (Pol) Pol IV and Pol V.  Pol IV plays a major role in siRNA biogenesis, while Pol V may recruit DNA methylation machinery to target endogenous loci for silencing. Although small RNA-generating regions which are dependent on both Pol IV and Pol V have been identified previously, the genomic loci targeted Pol V for siRNA accumulation and silencing have not been described extensively. To characterize the Pol V-dependent, heterochromatic siRNA-generating regions in the Arabidopsis genome, we deeply sequenced the small RNA populations of wild-type and Pol V mutant plants. Furthermore, we characterized the siRNA-generating regions which were dependent on RdDM effectors and examined their dependency on Pol V.  Small RNA libraries were generated and deeply sequenced from mutant alleles dms4-1, drd1-1, dms3-1, and rdm1-4, along with their control library (“Wt(T+S)”) which has been described previously (Kanno et al. 2004 Current Biology). More than 2,000 small RNA-generating loci were identified which were greatly suppressed in Pol V mutants.

H3.3 variants are enriched at active genes and their promoters. Furthermore, H3.3 is specifically incorporated upon gene activation. Histone H3 variants evolved independently in plants and animals and it is unclear whether different replication independent H3.3 variants developed similar properties in both phyla. We studied Arabidopsis H3 variants in order to find core properties of this class of histones. Here we present genome-wide maps of H3.3 and H3.1 enrichment and the dynamic changes of their profiles upon cell division arrest. We find H3.3 enrichment to positively correlate with gene expression and to be biased towards the transcription termination site. While heterochromatic regions are mostly depleted of H3.3, H3.1 shows a more even distribution along the genome. We report that in planta, dynamic changes in H3.3 profiles are associated with the extensive remodeling of the transcriptome that occurs during cell differentiation. We propose that H3.3 dynamics are linked to transcription and are involved in resetting covalent histone marks at a genomic scale during plant development. Similarities between plant and animal H3.3 deposition profiles indicate that H3 variants likely result from functionally convergent evolution.

Brassinosteroid (BR) plays essential roles in growth regulation by light and temperature, but the interactions between BR and these environmental signals remain poorly understood at the molecular level. Here, we show that direct interaction between the dark- and heat-activated transcription factor phytochrome-interacting factor4 (PIF4) and the BR-activated transcription factor BZR1 integrates the hormonal and environmental signals. BZR1 and PIF4 interact with each other in vitro and in vivo, bind to nearly two thousand common target genes, and synergistically regulate many of these target genes, including the PRE family HLH factors required for promoting cell elongation. Genetic analysis indicates that BZR1 and PIFs are interdependent in promoting cell elongation in response to BR, darkness, or heat. These results show that the BZR1-PIF4 interaction controls a core transcription network, allowing plant growth co-regulation by the steroid and environmental signals.

We isolated mutations in two Arabidopsis genes, CRT1 and CRH6, which cause de-repression of DNA-methylated genes and TEs, but no losses of DNA or histone methylation.  CRT1 and CRH6 are members of the conserved Microrchidia (MORC) ATPase family, predicted to catalyze alterations in chromosome superstructure.  The crt1 and crh6 mutants show decondensation of pericentromeric heterochromatin, increased interaction of pericentromeric regions with the rest of the genome, and transcriptional defects that are largely restricted to loci residing in pericentromeric regions.  Knockdown of the single MORC homolog in Caenorhabditis elegans also impairs transgene silencing.  We propose that the MORC ATPases are conserved regulators of gene silencing in eukaryotes.

PRJNA167620	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)DNA methyltransferases are required to induce heterochromatic re-replication in Arabidopsis.	"The relationship between epigenetic marks on chromatin and the regulation of DNA replication is poorly understood. Mutation of the H3K27 methyltransferase genes, ARABIDOPSIS TRITHORAX-RELATED PROTEIN5 (ATXR5) and ATXR6, result in re-replication (repeated origin firing within the same cell cycle). Here we show that mutations that reduce DNA methylation act to suppress the re-replication phenotype of atxr5 atxr6 mutants. This suggests that DNA methylation, a mark enriched at the same heterochromatic regions that re-replicate in atxr5/6 mutants, is required for aberrant re-replication. In contrast, RNA sequencing analyses suggest that ATXR5/6 and DNA methylation cooperatively transcriptionally silence transposable elements (TEs). Hence our results suggest a complex relationship between ATXR5/6 and DNA methylation in the regulation of DNA replication and transcription of TEs.

It involves long non-coding RNAs (lncRNAs)1, which in Arabidopsis thaliana are produced by a specialized RNA Polymerase V (Pol V)2. lncRNAs guide Argonaute-siRNA complexes to specific genomic loci and mediate the establishment of DNA methylation3,4. The mechanism by which lncRNAs affect chromatin structure and mRNA production remains mostly unknown. Here we identify the SWI/SNF nucleosome remodeling complex as a component of the RNA-mediated transcriptional silencing pathway. We found that SWI3, an essential subunit of the SWI/SNF complex, physically interacts with a lncRNA-binding IDN2 protein5,6. RNA-mediated DNA methylation and transcriptional silencing was compromised in the swi3 mutant. Moreover, targets of SWI/SNF significantly overlapped with genes controlled by Pol V, which shows that the physical interaction reflects a functional relationship. We further found that non-coding transcription by Pol V affects nucleosome positioning on silenced regions. We propose that lncRNAs mediate transcriptional silencing by guiding the SWI/SNF complex and establishing positioned nucleosomes on specific genomic loci. We further propose that guiding ATP-dependent chromatin remodeling complexes may be a more general function of lncRNAs.

Here we show cis- and trans-regulatory elements and chromatin modifications on gene-expression diversity in genetically tractable Arabidopsis allotetraploids. In Arabidopsis thaliana and Arabidopsis arenosa, both cis and trans with predominant cis-regulatory effects mediate gene-expression divergence. The majority of genes with both cis- and trans-effects are subjected to compensating interactions and stabilizing selection. Interestingly, chromatin modifications correlate with cis - and trans -regulation. In F1 allotetraploids, Arabidopsis arenosa trans factors predominately affect allelic expression divergence. Arabidopsis arenosa trans factors tend to upregulate Arabidopsis thaliana alleles, whereas Arabidopsis thaliana trans factors up- or down-regulate Arabidopsis arenosa alleles. In resynthesized and natural allotetraploids, trans effects drive expression of both homoeologous loci into the same direction. We provide evidence for natural selection and chromatin regulation in shaping gene-expression diversity during plant evolution and speciation.

The experimental induction of RNA silencing in plants often involves expression of transgenes encoding inverted repeat (IR) sequences to produce abundant dsRNAs that are processed into small RNAs (sRNAs). These sRNAs are key mediators of post-transcriptional gene silencing (PTGS) and determine the specificity of the inhibition of gene expression. Despite its broad utility as a research tool, IR-PTGS is only a partially understood mechanism of RNA silencing in plants. We generated four sets of 60 Arabidopsis plants, each containing IR transgenes expressing different configurations of uidA and CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS) gene fragments. The levels of PTGS were dependent on the orientation and position of the fragment in the IR construct. To investigate these differences, we characterized the sRNA profiles by Illumina sequencing of seven libraries generated from transgenic families showing different levels of IR-PTGS. Mapping of sRNA sequences to their corresponding transgene-derived and endogenous transcripts identified distinctive patterns of differential sRNA accumulation. Analyses of these patterns and peaks revealed similarities among sRNAs associated with IR-PTGS and endogenous sRNAs linked to uncapped mRNA decay. We also found unexpected associations between sRNA accumulation and the presence of predicted open reading frames in the trigger sequence. Our observations provide new guidelines for designing constructs to increase the efficiency of IR-PTGS. In addition, strong IR-PTGS affected the prevalence of endogenous sRNAs, which has implications for the use of PTGS for experimental or applied purposes.

Here we characterize HLP1, an hnRNP A/B protein as a novel regulator for pre-mRNA 3’ end processing in Arabidopsis. Genetic analysis reveals that HLP1 suppresses Flowering Locus C (FLC), a key repressor of flowering in Arabidopsis. Genome-wide mapping of HLP1-RNA interactions indicates that HLP1 binds preferentially to A-rich and U-rich elements around cleavage and polyadenylation sites, implicating a role in 3’-end formation. We show significantly enriched binding of HLP1 to transcripts involved in RNA metabolism and flowering. Comprehensive profiling of the poly(A) site usage reveals that HLP1 mutations cause thousands of poly(A) site shifts. A distal-to-proximal poly(A) site shift in the flowering regulator FCA, a direct target of HLP1, further leading to up-regulated FLC and delayed flowering. Our results elucidate that HLP1 is a novel factor involved in 3’ end processing and controls reproductive timing via targeted APA.

PRJNA169667	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Deposition of histone variant H2A.Z within gene bodies regulates responsive genes	"The regulation of eukaryotic chromatin relies on interactions between many epigenetic factors, including histone modifications, DNA methylation, and the incorporation of histone variants. H2A.Z, one of the most conserved but enigmatic histone variants that is enriched at the transcriptional start sites of genes, has been implicated in a variety of chromosomal processes.  Recently, we reported a genome-wide anticorrelation between H2A.Z and DNA methylation, an epigenetic hallmark of heterochromatin that has also been found in the bodies of active genes in plants and animals. Here, we investigate the basis of this anticorrelation using a novel h2a.z loss-of-function line in Arabidopsis thaliana. Through genome-wide bisulfite sequencing, we demonstrate that a loss of H2A.Z in Arabidopsis does not affect the level or profile of DNA methylation in genes, and we propose that the global anticorrelation between DNA methylation and H2A.Z is caused by the exclusion of H2A.Z from methylated DNA.  RNA-seq and genomic mapping of H2A.Z show that H2A.Z enrichment across gene bodies, rather than at the TSS, is correlated with lower transcription levels and higher measures of gene responsiveness.  We find that a loss of H2A.Z causes misregulation of many genes that are disproportionately associated with response to both endogenous and exogenous stimuli.

Genetic and molecular evidence indicates that a quartet of Arabidopsis Phytochrome (phy)-Interacting bHLH Factors (PIF1, 3, 4 and 5) are critically necessary to maintaining this developmental state, and that light activation of phy induces a switch to photomorphogenic development by inducing rapid degradation of the PIFs.

Here, we have identified targets of Pol V in Arabidopsis thaliana on a genome-wide scale using ChIP-seq of NRPE1, the largest catalytic subunit of Pol V. We found that Pol V is enriched at promoters and evolutionarily recent transposons. This localization pattern is highly correlated with Pol V-dependent DNA methylation and small RNA accumulation. We also show that genome-wide association of Pol V with chromatin is dependent on all members of a putative chromatin-remodeling complex termed DDR. Our study presents the first genome-wide view of Pol V occupancy and sheds light on the mechanistic basis of Pol V localization. Furthermore, these findings suggest a role for Pol V and RNA-directed DNA methylation in genome surveillance and in responding to genome evolution.

PRJNA172443	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Small RNA sequencing from Arabidopsis adult leaves and profiling of Arabidopsis transcripts in response to flg22 peptide	"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that silences transposable elements (TEs) and repeats. Whereas the establishment and maintenance of DNA methylation are relatively well understood, little is known on their dynamics and biological relevance in plant and animal innate immunity. Here, we show that some TEs are demethylated and transcriptionally reactivated during antibacterial defense in Arabidopsis. This effect is concomitant with the down-regulation of key transcriptional gene silencing factors as well as an active demethylation process. DNA demethylation restricts multiplication and vascular propagation of the bacterial pathogen Pseudomonas syringae in leaves and, accordingly, some immune-response genes, containing repeats in their promoters, are negatively regulated by DNA methylation. This study provides evidence that DNA demethylation is part of a plant-induced immune response, potentially acting to prime transcriptional activation of some defense genes linked to Tes/repeats.
We have monitored the transcript changes in Arabidopsis plants treated with a flagellin-derived peptide.

However, the global influence of this feature on plant gene expression is still for the most part unclear. Here, we use a high-throughput, sequencing-based, structure-mapping approach in conjunction with transcriptome-wide sequencing of polyA+-selected (RNA-seq), small (smRNA-seq), and ribosome-bound (ribo-seq) RNA populations to investigate the impact of RNA secondary structure on gene expression regulation in Arabidopsis. From this analysis, we find that highly unpaired and paired RNAs are strongly correlated with euchromatic and heterochromatic epigenetic histone modifications, respectively, providing further evidence that secondary structure is necessary for RNA-mediated posttranscriptional regulatory pathways. Additionally, we uncover key structural patterns across protein-coding transcripts that indicate RNA folding demarcates regions of protein translation and likely affects microRNA-mediated regulation of mRNAs in this model plant. We also reveal that RNA folding is significantly anti-correlated with overall transcript abundance, which is likely due to the increased propensity of highly structured mRNAs to be degraded and/or processed into smRNAs. Finally, we find that secondary structure affects mRNA translation, suggesting that this feature regulates plant gene expression at multiple levels. Overall, our findings provide the first global assessment of RNA folding and its significant regulatory effects in a plant transcriptome.

Signals generated by activated receptors are integrated inside the cell and converge on transcriptional programmes in the nucleus. The Arabidopsis Toll-related intracellular receptor RPS4 operates inside nuclei to trigger resistance and defence gene reprogramming through the stress response regulator, EDS1. Using a combinaison of ChIP-seq and gene expression microarray profiling, we found that RPS4 associates with the genomic coding sequence of (mainly) defense-associated genes whose expression is subsequently strongly upregulated. Using RNA-seq, we tested wether the association pattern of RPS4 to its targets correlates with alternative splicing of similar sets of genes.
Overall design: We used transgenic Arabidopsis plants over-expressing RPS4, a genetic background in which an immune response can be turned on rapidly and synchronously in leaf cells after a switch from high to moderate temperature. In order to substract defense-unrelated artifacts due to the temperature stimulus, we used Col-0 WT plants in parallel as negative control.

Many traits of Solanum lycopersicoides including cold tolerance, resistance to virus diseases and insect pests were previously confirmed. Thus, it is an ideal candidate plant for isolating cold-tolerance-related genes. In this study, we successfully cloned the full-length cDNA of the CBF1 gene from Solanum lycopersicoides which was designated as SsCBF1. In order to investigate the possible functions of SsCBF1 in plant growth and stress responses, we generated transgenic Arabidopsis overexpressing SsCBF1. We employed the RNA-seq approach to identify the differentially expressed genes between the two genotypes. Processing of RNA samples on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 system produced more than 20 million reads, each 100bp in length, encompassing 2.0 Gb of sequence data for each sample which was then mapped to the reference genome.

accumulation of plant microRNAs depends on RECEPTOR FOR ACTIVATED C KINASE 1 (RACK1), a scaffold protein found in all higher eukaryotes. miRNA levels are reduced in rack1 mutants and our data suggest that RACK1 affects the microRNA pathway via several distinct mechanisms involving direct interactions with known microRNA factors: RACK1 ensures the accumulation and processing of some pri-miRNAs, directly interacts with SERRATE and is part of an AGO1 complex. As a result, mutations in RACK1 lead to misregulation of miRNA target genes, which is important for ABA responses and phyllotaxy.

Nucleosome remodelers of the DDM1/Lsh family are thought to be specifically required to maintain transposon methylation, but the reason for this is unknown. Here, we find that a chromatin gradient that extends from the most heterochromatic transposons to euchromatic genes determines the requirement of DDM1 for methylation maintenance in all sequence contexts. We also show that small RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) is inhibited by heterochromatin and absolutely requires the nucleosome remodeler DRD1. DDM1 and RdDM independently mediate nearly all transposon methylation, which is catalyzed by the methyltransferases MET1 (CG), CMT3 (CHG), DRM2 (CHH) and CMT2 (CHH), and collaborate to repress transposition and regulate the methylation and expression of genes.

Moreover, differential transcript processing such as alternative precursor mRNA splicing (AS) can generate NMD substrates, however, the extent of coupled AS and NMD remained unclear. To investigate NMD targeting of AS variants, we performed transcriptome-wide splicing studies using Arabidopsis thaliana single and double mutants in the NMD factor homologues UPF1 and UPF3, as well as samples treated with the translation inhibitor cycloheximide (CHX). Our analyses revealed that at least 17.5% of all multi-exon, protein-coding genes produce splicing variants of all major types that are targeted by NMD, with a significant fraction originating from the splicing of cryptic introns. Furthermore, accumulation of many intron-retained mRNAs in the mutants, but not in response to CHX suggests the action of distinct routes of NMD with variable impact of translation. Importantly, 92.3% of the NMD-responsive mRNAs exhibit classical NMD-eliciting features, supporting their authenticity as direct targets. NMD-dependent AS variants are linked to diverse biological functions, including the poison exon-mediated regulation of signaling and posttranslational protein modification components. In addition to mRNAs, numerous non-coding RNAs as well as newly identified transcripts derived from intergenic regions were shown to be NMD responsive. In summary, our comprehensive analysis of AS-coupled NMD provides strong evidence for a major function of this pathway in shaping the transcriptome, having fundamental implications in gene regulation and quality control of transcript processing steps in higher eukaryotes.

PRJNA176941	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues from Arabidopsis are key regulators of alternative splicing with implications in fundamental developmental processes	"Alternative splicing (AS) generates transcript variants by the definition of different exonic and intronic regions and causes a massive expansion of transcriptome diversity. Changes in AS patterns have been found to be linked to manifold biological processes, yet fundamental aspects such as the regulation of AS and the functional implications of altered AS programs largely remain to be addressed. In this work, widespread AS regulation by Arabidopsis Polypyrimidine tract-binding protein homologues (AtPTBs) was revealed. In total 452 AS events derived from 308 distinct genes were found to be responsive to the levels of the splicing factors AtPTB1 and AtPTB2, which predominantly triggered splicing of regulated introns, inclusion of cassette exons, and usage of upstream 5' splice sites. In contrast, alternative 3' splice site events were strongly underrepresented among the AtPTB1/2 targets and no major AS regulatory function of the distantly related AtPTB3 was found. Dependent on their position within the mRNA, AtPTB-regulated events can both modify the untranslated regions and give rise to alternative protein products. Gene ontology analysis revealed a connection of AtPTB-mediated AS control with diverse biological processes, and the functional implications of selected AS events were further elucidated in the context of seed germination and flowering time control. Specifically, AtPTB misexpression changes AS of the PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR 6 (PIF6) pre-mRNA, coinciding with altered rates of abscisic acid-dependent seed germination. Furthermore, AS patterns as well as the expression of key flowering regulators were massively changed in an AtPTB1/2 level-dependent manner. In conclusion, our work has revealed widespread AS regulatory functions of the AtPTB splicing factors with important functional implications in various fundamental processes of Arabidopsis development.

TE methylation is established and reinforced by a mechanism of RNA-dependent DNA methylation, which is dependent on transcription of the PolIV RNA polymerase. Recently, a pathway has been described that initiates de novo DNA methylation dependent on components of the RNAi post-transcriptional silencing pathway, independent of PolIV. To define the function of this new pathway, we have focused on the RDR6 protein, which plays a central role in the pathway we refer to as RDR6-dependent RNA-directed DNA Methylation (RDR6-RdDM).
Methods: We have sequenced total small RNAs from wild-type and three mutant genotypes: ddm1, ddm1/rdr6, and rdr6.
Conclusions: We demonstrate that RDR6-RdDM utilizes 21 and 22 nucleotide siRNAs to de novo methylate actively transcribing TEs. In addition, we find that the RDR6-RdDM pathway functions in the efficient initiation and re-establishment of TE transcriptional silencing, while it is not necessary to maintain trans-generational epigenetic silencing.

But the molecular mechanism by which PREs and IBH1 regulate gene expression has remained unknown. Here we show that IBH1 interacts with and inhibits a DNA-binding bHLH protein HBI1. Overexpression of HBI1 increased hypocotyl and petiole elongation, whereas dominant inactivation of HBI1 and its homologs caused a dwarf phenotype, indicating that HBI1 is a positive regulator of cell elongation. In vitro and in vivo experiments showed that HBI1 directly bound to the promoters and activated two EXPANSIN genes encoding cell wall-loosening enzymes; HBI1’s DNA-binding and transcriptional activities were inhibited by IBH1, but the inhibitory effects of IBH1 were abolished by PRE1. The results indicate that PREs activate the DNA-binding bHLH factor HBI1 by sequestering its inhibitor IBH1. Altering each of the three factors affected plant sensitivities to BR, GA, temperature, and light. Our study demonstrates that PREs, IBH1 and HBI1 form a chain of antagonistic switches that controls cell elongation downstream of multiple external and endogenous signals.

PRJNA178309	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)A Role for the RNA-Binding Protein MOS2 in MicroRNA Maturation in Arabidopsis	"microRNAs (miRNAs) play important roles in the regulation of gene expression. In Arabidopsis, mature miRNAs are processed from primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRNAs) by nuclear HYL1/SE/DCL1 complexes that form Dicing bodies (D-bodies). Here we report that a RNA-binding protein MOS2 bound to pri-miRNAs and was required for their efficient processing. MOS2 did not interact with HYL1, SE, and DCL1 and was not localized in D-bodies. Interestingly, in the absence of MOS2, the recruitment of pri-miRNAs by HYL1 was greatly reduced and the localization of HYL1 in D-bodies was compromised. These data suggest that MOS2 facilitates pri-miRNA processing through facilitating the recruitment of pri-miRNAs by the Dicing complexes.

Here, we showed that both density and length of root hairs of Arabidopsis decreased logarithmically with increasing Mg supply in the media , which correlated with the initiation of new trichoblast files and likelihood of trichoblasts to form hairs. Low Mg resulted in greater concentrations of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca2+ in the roots and displayed a stronger tip-focused gradient of ROS and cytosolic Ca2+ concentration ([Ca2+]c) during initiation and elongation of root hairs. This gradient could be eliminated by DPI or BAPTA. Application of either DPI or BAPTA to low Mg treatment blocked the enhanced development of root hairs. The opposite was true when the plants under high Mg were supplied with Ca2+ or PMS. Whole-genome transcriptome data revealed that the maximum differential expressed genes involved in ‘stress’, ‘oxidation reduction’, ‘ion transport and homeostasis’ and ‘cell wall organization’. A greater fraction of morphogenetic H-genes and root hair -specific genes as well as genes involved in ‘cell wall structure’ were up-regulated by 7-d treatment of 0.5 μM Mg but down-regulated by 7-d treatment of 10,000 μM Mg. It is concluded that a distinct and previously poorly characterized response of root hair development to Mg availability is presented in Arabidopsis where ROS and Ca2+ are the signaling molecules that control this response.

The elaborate mechanism of miRNA biogenesis involves transcription and multiple processing steps. Here, we report the identification of a pair of evolutionarily conserved NOT2_3_5 domain containing proteins, NOT2a and NOT2b (previously known as At-NOT2 and VIP2, respectively), as components involved in Arabidopsis miRNA biogenesis. NOT2 was identified by its interaction with the Piwi/Ago/Zwille (PAZ) domain of Dicer-like 1 (DCL1), an interaction that is conserved between rice and Arabidopsis. Inactivation of both NOT2 genes in Arabidopsis caused severe defects in male gametophytes, and weak lines show pleiotropic defects reminiscent of miRNA pathway mutants. Impairment of NOT2s decreases the accumulation of pri-miRNAs and mature miRNAs and increases DCL1-containing nuclear speckle number in vivo. In addition, NOT2b protein interacts with Pol II and other miRNA processing factors including two cap-binding proteins, CBP80/ABH1, CBP20 and SERRATE (SE). Therefore, these results suggest that NOT2 proteins promote MIR transcription and facilitate efficient DCL1 recruitment in Arabidopsis.

To identify causal mechanisms, we compared 3 DAP transcriptomes of compatible and incompatible hybrids and parents at 3 DAP. Hybrids misexpressed endosperm and seed coat regulators, and hyperactivated genes encoding ribosomal, photosynthetic, stress-related and immune response proteins. Regulatory disruption was more severe in Col-0 hybrids than in C24 hybrids, consistent with the degree of incompatibility. Maternal loss-of-function alleles for endosperm growth factor TRANSPARENT TESTA GLABRA 2 and HAIKU 1, and defense response regulators NON-EXPRESSOR OF PATHOGENESIS RELATED 1 and SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION-DEFICIENT 2 ,  increased hybrid seed survival. The activation of presumed POLYCOMB REPRESSIVE COMPLEX (PRC) targets, together with a twenty-fold reduction in expression of FERTILIZATION INDEPENDENT SEED 2, indicated a PRC role. Proximity to transposable elements affected natural vartiation for gene regulation, but transposon activation did not differ from controls. Collectively, this investigation provides candidates for multigenic orchestration of the incompatibility response through disruption of endosperm development, a novel role for communication between endosperm and maternal tissues and for pathways previously connected to immunity, but, surprisingly, does not identify a role for transposons.

Inhibition of TOR in BP12 plants by rapamycin resulted in slower overall root, leaf and shoot growth and development leading to poor nutrient uptake and light energy utilization. Genetic and physiological studies together with RNA-Seq and metabolite analysis of TOR-suppressed lines revealed that TOR regulates development and lifespan in Arabidopsis by restructuring cell growth, carbon and nitrogen metabolism, gene expression, ribosomal RNA and protein synthesis.

This process is mostly investigated at steady states reflecting how long-established silent conditions are maintained, faithfully re-iterated or temporarily modified during growth, stress and over generations. How invasive TEs are detected and silenced de novo, however, remains largely unknown. Using inbred lineages of hybrid Arabidopsis epigenomes combining wild-type and met1 or ddm1 chromosomes, we have deciphered the timing, spatial distribution and mechanisms underpinning the proliferation and eventual demise of the endogenous retrotransposon évadé (EVD). Both developmental and molecular features of EVD biology, including a remarkable ability to evade RNA interference, ultimately contribute to its silencing over multiple generations.

Recent evidences have revealed the potential participation of mRNA decay control in some aspects of glucose-mediated regulatory responses suggesting a role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in these responses. In order to get a better understanding of glucose-mediated development modulation involving miRNA-related regulatory pathways, early seedling development of mutants impaired in miRNA biogenesis (hyl1-2) and miRNA-activity (ago1-25) were evaluated. Both mutants exhibited a glucose hyposensitive phenotype from germination up to seedling establishment, indicating that miRNA regulatory pathways may be involved in the glucose-mediated delay of early seedling development. The expression profile of 200 primary miRNA transcripts (pri-miRs) were evaluated by large-scale quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) profiling revealing that 38 pri-miRs were regulated by glucose. For several of them, the corresponding mature miRNAs are known to participate directly or indirectly in plant development, and their accumulation was shown to be co-regulated with the pri-miRNA by glucose. These data indicate that deficiency in miRNA machinery leads to a deregulated expression of several miRNA target genes in response to glucose. Also, such deficiencies result in glucose-promoted misexpression of genes for the three Abscisic Acid signaling elements ABI3, ABI4 and ABI5. Thus, miRNA-regulatory pathways play a role in the adjustments of growth and development triggered by glucose signaling.

PRJNA188503	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Analysis of the nitrate-responsive transcriptome of the Arabidopsis root	"Nitrate and other nitrogen metabolites can act as signals that regulate global gene expression in plants. Adaptive changes in plant morphology and physiology triggered by changes in nitrate availability are partly explained by these changes in gene expression. Despite several genome-wide efforts to identify nitrate-regulated genes, no comprehensive study of the Arabidopsis root transcriptome under contrasting nitrate conditions has been carried out. In this work, we employed the Illumina high throughput sequencing technology to perform an integrated analysis of the poly-A+ enriched and the small RNA fractions of the Arabidopsis thaliana root transcriptome in response to nitrate treatments. Our sequencing strategy identified new nitrate-regulated genes including 40 genes not represented in the ATH1 Affymetrix GeneChip, a novel nitrate-responsive antisense transcript and a new nitrate responsive miRNA/TARGET module consisting of a novel microRNA, miR5640 and its target, AtPPC3. This nitrate-responsive miRNA/target module might be involved in controlling carbon flux to assimilate nitrate into amino acids, suggesting that microRNAs can have both developmental and metabolic functions in the nitrate response of Arabidopsis roots.
Overall design: Arabidopsis thaliana wild-type Col-0 plants were grown in hydroponic nitrate-free medium with 0.5 mM ammonium succinate as the only N-source for two weeks and were treated with 5 mM KNO3, or 5 mM KCl as control, for 2 hours.

However, in model plant Arabidopsis, novel intermediate-sized ncRNAs (im-ncRNAs) (50~300nt) have very limited information. By using a modified isolation strategy combined with deep-sequencing technology, we identified 838 im-ncRNAs in Arabidopsis globally. More than half (58%) are new ncRNA species, mostly evolutionary divergent. Interestingly, annotated protein-coding genes with 5’-UTR derived novel im-ncRNAs tend to be highly expressed. For intergenic im-ncRNAs, their average abundances were comparable to mRNAs in seedlings, but subsets exhibited significantly lower expression in senescing leaves. Further, intergenic im-ncRNAs were regulated by similar genetic and epigenetic mechanisms as those of protein-coding genes, and some showed developmentally-regulated expression patterns. Large-scale reverse genetic screening showed that the down-regulation of a number of im-ncRNAs resulted in either obvious molecular changes or abnormal developmental phenotypes in vivo, indicating the functional importance of im-ncRNAs in plant growth and development. Together, our results demonstrate that novel Arabidopsis im-ncRNAs are developmentally-regulated and functional components discovered in the transcriptome.

PRJNA189178	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)DTF1 is a core component of RNA-directed DNA methylation and may assist in the recruitment of Pol IV	"DNA methylation is an important epigenetic mark in many eukaryotic organisms.  De novo DNA methylation in plants can be achieved by the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway, where the plant-specific DNA-dependent RNA polymerase Pol IV transcribes target sequences to initiate 24-nt siRNA production and action.  The Arabidopsis DTF1/SHH1 has been shown to associate with Pol IV and is required for 24-nt siRNA accumulation and transcriptional silencing at several RdDM target loci.  However, the extent and mechanism of DTF1 function in RdDM is unclear.  We show here that DTF1 is necessary for the accumulation of the majority of Pol IV-dependent 24-nt siRNAs.  It is also required for a large proportion of Pol IV-dependent de novo DNA methylation.  Interestingly, there is a group of RdDM target loci where 24-nt siRNA accumulation but not DNA methylation is dependent on DTF1.  Taken together, our results show that DTF1 is a core component of the RdDM pathway. Our results also suggest the involvement of DTF1 in an important negative feedback mechanism for DNA methylation at some RdDM target loci.

They have been shown to play major roles in a variety of plant processes including development, and responses to pathogens and environmental stresses. To identify new miRNAs and regulation in Arabidopsis thaliana, 27 small RNA libraries were constructed and sequenced from various tissues, stresses and small RNA biogenesis mutants, resulting in 95 million genome-matched sequences. The use of rdr2 to enrich the miRNA population greatly enhanced this analysis and led to the discovery of 44 new miRNAs arising from both known and new precursors. Parallel Analysis of RNA Ends (PARE) data provide evidence that the majority guide target cleavage. The inclusion of novel stress/tissue conditions, such as submergence-stressed flowers, enabled identification of new stress regulation of both miRNAs and their targets, all of which were validated in wild type plants. By combining small RNA expression analysis with ARGONAUTE (AGO) immunoprecipitation data and global target cleavage data from PARE, a much more complete picture of Arabidopsis miRNAs was obtained. This combinatorial approach led to the discovery of AGO loading and target cleavage biases, which gave important insights into tissue-specific expression patterns, pathogen responses and the role of sequence variation among closely related miRNA family members.

This pathway requires two plant-specific RNA polymerases: Pol-IV, which functions to initiate siRNA biogenesis and Pol-V, which functions in the downstream DNA methyltransferase targeting phase of the RdDM pathway to generate scaffold transcripts that recruit downstream RdDM factors1,2. To understand the mechanisms controlling Pol-IV targeting we investigated the function of SAWADEE HOMEODOMAIN HOMOLOG 1 (SHH1)3,4, a Pol-IV interacting protein3. Here we show that SHH1 acts upstream in the RdDM pathway to enable siRNA production from a large subset of the most active RdDM targets and that SHH1 is required for Pol-IV occupancy at these same loci. We also show that the SHH1 SAWADEE domain is a novel chromatin binding module that adopts a unique tandem Tudor-like fold and functions as a dual lysine reader, probing for both unmethylated K4 and methylated K9 modifications on the histone 3 (H3) tail. Finally, we show that key residues within both lysine binding pockets of SHH1 are required in vivo to maintain siRNA and DNA methylation levels as well as Pol-IV occupancy at RdDM targets, demonstrating a central role for methyl H3K9 binding in SHH1 function and providing the first insights into the mechanism of Pol-IV targeting. Given the parallels between methylation systems in plants and mammals1,5, a further understanding of this early targeting step may aid in our ability to control the expression of endogenous and newly introduced genes, which has broad implications for agriculture and gene therapy.
Overall design: For wild type plants (ecotype Columbia) and RdDM mutants whole-genome small RNA (sRNA-seq) and bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) was performed. The Col and nrpe1 BS-seq libraries were previously reported (GSE39247) and so are not part of this submission. In addition, two replicates of whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) was performed on wild type (ecotype Columbia) plants as a negative control with experimentals consiting of nrpd1 mutant plants carrying a C-terminally epitope tagged (3XFLAG) NRPD1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and small RNA sequencing was also performed on shh1 mutant plants transformed with the wild-type SHH1 protein-coding construct as well as multiple constructs containing point mutations. For these complementation libraries a separate shh1 mutant and Col control line were sequenced (“complementation replicates”). Less..."

PRJEB1440	Single-cell RNA-seq for pGL2 and QC cells from the Arabidopsis thaliana root	To demonstrate our method of controlling for technical noise in single-cell RNA-seq experiments we manually collected single A. thaliana cells marked by the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) driven by either the GL2 or WOX5 promoters. Seven and six cells were collected from each cell type, respectively. The GL2 promoter marks the non-hair cells in the root epidermis whereas the WOX5 promoter specifies the quiescent center (QC) of the root.  Each cell selected was processed together with 50 pg of total HeLa RNA spike-in to prepare RNA-seq libraries using the Tang protocol. For comparison, we again added the commercially available ERCC spike-ins. We also performed RNA-seq on a set of technical replicates of total A. thaliana RNA using starting amounts ranging from 5000pg down to 10pg, a range that covers the RNA content obtainable from single cells of various sizes.

PRJNA194426	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Columbia-0 (thale cress)Identification of Cytokinin-Responsive Genes Using Microarray Meta-Analysis and RNA-Seq in Arabidopsis	Cytokinins are N6-substituted adenine derivatives that play diverse roles in plant growth and development. We sought to define a robust set of genes regulated by cytokinin, as well as to query the response of genes not represented on microarrays. To this end, we performed a meta- analysis of microarray data from a variety of cytokinin-treated samples and used RNA-seq to examine cytokinin-regulated gene expression in Arabidopsis thaliana. Microarray meta-analysis using thirteen microarray experiments combined with empirically-defined filtering criteria identified a set of 226 genes differentially regulated by cytokinin, a subset of which have previously been validated by other methods. RNA-seq validated about 73% of the up-regulated genes identified by this meta-analysis. In silico promoter analysis indicated an over- representation of type-B ARR binding elements, consistent with the role of type-B ARRs as primary mediators of cytokinin-responsive gene expression. RNA-seq analysis identified 73 cytokinin-regulated genes that were not represented on the ATH1 microarray. Representative genes were verified using qRT-PCR and NanoString analysis. Analysis of the genes identified reveals a substantial effect of cytokinin on genes encoding proteins involved in secondary metabolism, particularly those acting in flavonoid and phenylpropanoid biosynthesis, as well as in the regulation of redox state of the cell, particularly a set of glutaredoxin genes. Novel splicing events were found in members of some gene families that are known to play a role in cytokinin signaling or metabolism. The genes identified in this analysis represent a robust set of cytokinin- responsive genes that are useful in the analysis of cytokinin function in plants. Less...	
PRJNA195608	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Understanding transcriptional changes associated with the transition to selfing in Arabidopsis thaliana	"RNA-seq reads from the selfing species Arabidopsis thaliana were produced from flowers to study the consequences of the transition from the ancestral state (outcrossing) to the derived state (selfing). This was done in the context of examining another species in the Arabidopsis genus (A. lyrata) and another species pair (Capsella rubella versus Capsella grandiflora, which are selfing and outcrossing, respectively). These samples were generated to complement part of this larger study. Briefly, the shift from outcrossing to selfing is common in flowering plants, but neither the genomic consequences nor the speed with which they appear are well understood. An excellent model for understanding the evolution of self fertilization is provided by Capsella rubella, which became self-compatible <200,000 years ago. We present a reference genome for the species, and compare RNA expression and polymorphism patterns between C. rubella and its outcrossing progenitor C. grandiflora. There is a clear shift in the expression of genes associated with flowering phenotypes; a similar shift is seen in the related genus Arabidopsis, where self-fertilization evolved about 1 million years ago. DNA sequence polymorphisms distinguishing the two Capsella species reveal rapid genome-wide relaxation of purifying selection in C. rubella but without a concomitant change in transposable element abundance. Overall, we document that the transition to selfing may be typified by shifts in expression for genes that function in pollen and flower development, along with a measurable reduction of purifying selection.
Overall design: As part of a cross-species comparison of gene expression, RNA-seq data was generated in biological replication (2 replicates) from Arabidopsis thaliana at the floral stage. In total, two samples (biological replicates) were used. The reference strain was used for the experments (strain Col-0). Resulting data about gene expression was used as part of a larger study.

Results: The AGO1 protein incorporates large quantities of transposable element siRNAs when transposable elements are epigenetically activated and transcribed. The incorporation of transposable element siRNAs is at the expense of the most abundant microRNAs. These transposable element siRNAs can act as tasiRNAs, regulating genes that they have partial complementarity to.

PRJNA196840	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)EXPRSS: an Illumina based high-throughput expression-profiling method to reveal transcriptional dynamics - I	"Background
Next Generation Sequencing technologies have facilitated differential gene expression analysis through RNA-seq and Tag-seq methods. RNA-seq has biases associated with transcript lengths, lacks uniform coverage of regions in mRNA and requires 10–20 times more reads than a typical Tag-seq. Most existing Tag-seq methods either have biases or not high throughput due to use of restriction enzymes or enzymatic manipulation of 5’ ends of mRNA or use of RNA ligations.
Results
We have developed EXpression Profiling through Randomly Sheared cDNA tag Sequencing (EXPRSS) that employs acoustic waves to randomly shear cDNA and generate sequence tags at a relatively defined position (~150-200 bp) from the 3′ end of each mRNA. Implementation of the method was verified through comparative analysis of expression data generated from EXPRSS, NlaIII-DGE and Affymetrix microarray and through qPCR quantification of selected genes. EXPRSS is a strand specific and restriction enzyme independent tag sequencing method that does not require cDNA length-based data transformations. EXPRSS is highly reproducible, is high-throughput and it also reveals alternative polyadenylation and polyadenylated antisense transcripts. It is cost-effective using barcoded multiplexing, avoids the biases of existing SAGE and derivative methods and can reveal polyadenylation position from paired-end sequencing.
Conclusions
EXPRSS Tag-seq provides sensitive and reliable gene expression data and enables high-throughput expression profiling with relatively simple downstream analysis.

PRJNA200315	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Multiple RNA recognition patterns during microRNA biogenesis in plants	"MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are processed from longer precursors with fold-back structures. While animal MIRNA precursors have homogenous structures, plant precursors comprise a collection of fold-backs with variable size and shape. Here, we design an approach (SPARE) to systematically analyze miRNA processing intermediates and characterize the biogenesis of most of the evolutionary conserved miRNAs present in Arabidopsis thaliana. We found that plant MIRNAs are processed by four mechanisms, depending on the sequential direction of the processing machinery and the number of cuts required to release the miRNA. Classification of the precursors according to their processing mechanism revealed specific structural determinants for each group. We found that the complexity of the miRNA processing pathways occurs in both ancient and evolutionary young sequences, and that members of the same family can be processed in different ways. We observed that different structural determinants compete for the processing machinery and that alternative miRNAs can be generated from a single precursor. The results provide a mechanistic explanation for the structural diversity of MIRNA precursors in plants and new insights towards the understanding of the biogenesis of small RNAs.
Overall design: Approach to systematically analyze miRNA processing intermediates and characterize the biogenesis of conserved and young miRNAs present in Arabidopsis thaliana.

PRJNA194429	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Columbia-0 (thale cress)High-throughput sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana pollen cDNA uncovers novel transcription and alternative splicing	Pollen grains of Arabidopsis thaliana contain two haploid sperm cells enclosed in a haploid vegetative cell. Upon germination, the vegetative cell extrudes a pollen tube that carries the sperm to an ovule for fertilization. Knowing the identity, relative abundance, and splicing patterns of pollen transcripts will improve understanding of pollen and allow investigation of tissue-specific splicing in plants. Most Arabidopsis pollen transcriptome studies have used the ATH1 microarray, which does not assay splice variants and lacks specific probe sets for many genes. To investigate the pollen transcriptome, we performed high-throughput sequencing (RNA-Seq) of Arabidopsis pollen and seedlings for comparison. Gene expression was more diverse in seedling, and genes involved in cell wall biogenesis were highly expressed in pollen. RNA-Seq detected at least 4,172 protein coding genes expressed in pollen, including 289 assayed only by non-specific probe sets. Additional exons and previously unannotated 5’ and 3’ UTRs for pollen-expressed genes were revealed. We detected regions in the genome not previously annotated as expressed; 14 were tested and 12 confirmed by PCR. Gapped read alignments revealed 1,908 high-confidence new splicing events supported by 10 or more spliced read alignments. Alternative splicing patterns in pollen and seedling were highly correlated. For most alternatively spliced genes, the ratio of variants in pollen and seedling was similar, except for some encoding proteins involved in RNA splicing. This study highlights the robustness of splicing patterns in plants and the importance of on-going annotation and visualization of RNA-Seq data using interactive tools such as Integrated Genome Browser.

PRJNA203678	Improved genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts in eukaryotes—GMUCT 2.0	"The advent of high-throughput sequencing has led to an explosion of studies into the diversity, expression, processing, and lifespan of RNAs.  Recently, three different high-throughput sequencing-based methods have been developed to specifically study RNAs that are in the process of being degraded.  All three methods—genome-wide mapping of uncapped and cleaved transcripts (GMUCT), parallel analysis of RNA ends (PARE), and degradome sequencing—take advantage of the fact that Illumina sequencing libraries use T4 RNA ligase 1 to ligate an adapter to the 5’ end of RNAs that have a free 5’-monophosphate.  This condition for T4 RNA ligase 1 substrates means that mature mRNAs are not substrates of the enzyme because they have a 5’-cap.  As a result, these sequencing libraries are specifically made up of clones of decapped or degrading mRNAs and the 3’ fragment of cleaved miRNA and siRNA targets.  In this paper, we present a massively streamlined protocol for GMUCT that takes 2-3 days and can be initiated with as little as 5 µg of starting total RNA and involves only one gel size-selection step.  We show that the results are similar to libraries made using the previous GMUCT protocol and PARE.
Overall design: GMUCT libraries were made from flower buds of the Arabidopsis thaliana accession Columbia (Col-0) and three human cell lines—the cervical cancer cell line HeLa, human embryonic kidney 293 T (HEK293T) cell line, and the human chronic myelogenous leukaemia cell line K562—two replicates of each.  Matched mRNA-seq libraries were made for each Col-0 GMUCT replicate. These libraries were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 and the reads were trimmed to remove the adapter sequences (TGGAATTCTCGGGTGCCAAGGAACTCCAGTCA). The abundance of each unique read was determined, and unique reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis and human genomes, respectively. Less..."

PRJNA205864	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Selection of epigenetic variation in Arabidopsis [SNP data]	"In Arabidopsis thaliana a high rate of spontaneous epigenetic variation can occur in the DNA methylome in the absence of genetic variation and selection. It has been of great interest, whether natural epigenetic variation is subject to selection and contributes to fitness and adaptation in selective environments. We compared the variation in selected phenotypic traits, genome-wide cytosine DNA methylation and gene expression in two Arabidopsis recombinant inbred lines, which had undergone five generations of selection in experimental landscapes relative to their genetically identical ancestors. Selected populations exerted significant differences in flowering time and the number of branches and fruits, differences that were maintained over two to three generations in the absence of selection. We identified 4,629 and 5,158 differentially methylated cytosines which were overrepresented in genes that regulate flowering time, epigenetic processes, development and morphogenesis. Differentially methylated genes were enriched in differentially expressed genes. Thus, epigenetic variation is subject to selection and may play an important role in the adaptive response of populations in rapidly changing natural environments.

PRJNA209324	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Four distinct types of dehydration stress memory genes in Arabidopsis thaliana	"Arabidopsis plants that have experienced stress from water withdrawal show an improved ability to tolerate subsequent exposures as a ‘memory’ from the previous stress. This physiological stress memory is associated with ‘transcriptional memory’ illustrated by a subset of dehydrations stress responding genes that produce significantly different transcript amounts during repeated dehydration stresses relative to their response in the first. Here we report the genome-wide representation of dehydration stress transcriptional memory genes in A. thaliana. We identify four novel transcription patterns in response to repeated dehydration stress treatments. The nature of the proteins encoded by genes from each type of memory-response pattern is analyzed and the consequences of the genes’ memory behavior are considered in the context of possible biological relevance. The memory behavior of genes co-regulated by the dehydration/ABA and other abiotic stress and hormone responding pathways suggested that the crosstalk at the transcriptional level between them was affected as well. The intensity and the nature of specific biochemical, membrane, chloroplast, and stress response-related interactions during multiple exposures to dehydration stress are different from the responses to a single dehydration stress. The results reveal additional, hitherto unknown, levels of complexity of the plants’ transcriptional behavior when adjusting and adapting to recurring water deficits.

PRJNA209363	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The Nuclear Immune Receptor RPS4 Is Required for RRS1SLH1-Dependent Constitutive Defense Activation in Arabidopsis thaliana.	"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) disease resistance (R) proteins recognize specific “avirulent” pathogen effectors and activate immune responses. NB-LRR proteins structurally and functionally resemble mammalian Nod-like receptors (NLRs). How NB-LRR and NLR proteins activate defense is poorly understood. The divergently transcribed Arabidopsis R genes, RPS4 (resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 4) and RRS1 (resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum 1), function together to confer recognition of Pseudomonas AvrRps4 and Ralstonia PopP2. RRS1 is the only known recessive NB-LRR R gene and encodes a WRKY DNA binding domain, prompting suggestions that it acts downstream of RPS4 for transcriptional activation of defense genes. We define here the early RRS1-dependent transcriptional changes upon delivery of PopP2 via Pseudomonas type III secretion. The Arabidopsis slh1 (sensitive to low humidity 1) mutant encodes an RRS1 allele (RRS1SLH1) with a single amino acid (leucine) insertion in the WRKY DNA-binding domain. Its poor growth due to constitutive defense activation is rescued at higher temperature. Transcription profiling data indicate that RRS1SLH1-mediated defense activation overlaps substantially with AvrRps4- and PopP2-regulated responses. To better understand the genetic basis of RPS4/RRS1-dependent immunity, we performed a genetic screen to identify suppressor of slh1 immunity (sushi) mutants. We show that many sushi mutants carry mutations in RPS4, suggesting that RPS4 acts downstream or in a complex with RRS1. Interestingly, several mutations were identified in a domain C-terminal to the RPS4 LRR domain. Using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay system, we demonstrate that the P-loop motif of RPS4 but not of RRS1SLH1 is required for RRS1SLH1 function. We also recapitulate the dominant suppression of RRS1SLH1 defense activation by wild type RRS1 and show this suppression requires an intact RRS1 P-loop. These analyses of RRS1SLH1 shed new light on mechanisms by which NB-LRR protein pairs activate defense signaling, or are held inactive in the absence of a pathogen effector.

Lack of genome-wide in vivo RNA structural data, however, has limited our understanding of how RNA structure regulates gene expression in living cells. Here we present a high throughput, genome-wide in vivo RNA structure probing method, “Structure-Seq”, in which dimethylsulfate (DMS) methylation of unprotected As and Cs is identified by next generation sequencing. Application of this method to Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings yielded the first in vivo genome-wide RNA structure map at nucleotide resolution for any organism, with quantitative structural information across more than 10,000 transcripts. Our analysis reveals a three nucleotide periodic repeat pattern in the structure of coding regions, as well as a less structured region immediately upstream of the start codon, and shows that these features are strongly correlated with translation efficiency. We also found patterns of strong and weak secondary structure at sites of alternative polyadenylation, as well as strong secondary structure at 5’-splice sites that correlates with unspliced events. Remarkably, in vivo structures of mRNAs annotated for stress responses are poorly predicted in silico, while mRNA structures of genes related to cell function maintenance are well predicted. Global comparison of several structural features between these two categories shows that the mRNAs associated with stress responses tend to have more single-strandedness, longer maximal loop length, and higher free energy per nucleotide, features that may allow these RNAs to undergo conformational changes in response to environmental conditions. Structure-Seq allows the RNA structurome and its biological roles to be interrogated on a genome-wide scale and should be applicable to any organism. Less...

One approach to find answers to this question would be to see which pathways or genes are being affected in mutant plants due to the disruption of AtCLB gene function. To achieve this, we sought a global transcriptome profiling of the mutant plant in comparison to its wild type counterpart.

PRJNA210809	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Columbia (Col-0) (thale cress)Targeted genomic enrichment of long DNA fragments flanking a known core sequence in Arabidopsis thaliana	We developed a solution-based targeted genomic enrichment methodology to capture, enrich and sequence flanking genomic regions surrounding conserved MIRNA genes with a locked-nucleic acid (LNA)-modified, biotinylated probe complementary to the mature miRNA sequence. Genomic DNA bound by the probe is captured by streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, amplified, sequenced and assembled de novo to obtain genomic DNA sequences flanking MIRNA locus of interest. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this method by sequencing a captured sample in Arabidopsis thaliana.

PRJNA213000	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Interplay Between Active Chromatin Marks and RNA-directed DNA Methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana	"DNA methylation is an epigenetic mark that is associated with transcriptional repression of transposable elements and protein coding genes. Conversely, transcriptionally active regulatory regions are strongly correlated with histone 3 lysine 4 di- and trimethylation (H3K4m2/3). We previously showed that Arabidopsis thaliana plants with mutations in the H3K4m2/m3 demethylase JUMONJI 14 (JMJ14) exhibit a mild reduction in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) that is associated with an increase in H3K4m2/m3 levels. To determine whether this incomplete RdDM reduction was the result of redundancy with other demethylases, we examined the genetic interaction of JMJ14 with another class of H3K4 demethylases: LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 1-LIKE 1 and LYSINE-SPECIFIC DEMETHYLASE 1-LIKE 2 (LDL1 and LDL2). Genome-wide DNA methylation analyses reveal that both families impact RdDM, but not other DNA methylation pathways. ChIP-seq experiments show that regions that exhibit an observable DNA methylation decrease are co-incidental with increases in H3K4m2/m3. Interestingly, the impact on DNA methylation was stronger at DNA-methylated regions adjacent to H3K4m2/m3-marked protein coding genes, suggesting that the activity of H3K4 demethylases may be particularly crucial to prevent spreading of active epigenetic marks. Finally, RNA sequencing analyses indicate that at RdDM targets, the increase of H3K4m2/m3 is not generally associated with transcriptional de-repression. This suggests that the histone mark itself—not transcription—impacts the extent of RdDM.
Overall design: For wild type plants (ecotype Columbia) and RdDM mutants whole-genome small RNA (sRNA-seq) and bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) was performed. The Col and nrpe1 BS-seq libraries were previously reported (GSE39247) and so are not part of this submission. In addition, two replicates of whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) was performed on wild type (ecotype Columbia) plants as a negative control with experimentals consiting of nrpd1 mutant plants carrying a C-terminally epitope tagged (3XFLAG) NRPD1. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing and small RNA sequencing was also performed on shh1 mutant plants transformed with the wild-type SHH1 protein-coding construct as well as multiple constructs containing point mutations. For these complementation libraries a separate shh1 mutant and Col control line were sequenced (“complementation replicates”). Less..."

Here we investigate the efficacy of 22-nt artificial miRNA (amiRNA) mediated RNA silencing relative to conventional hairpin RNA (hpRNA) and 21-nt amiRNA mediated RNA silencing. CHALCONE SYNTHASE (CHS) was selected as a target in Arabidopsis thaliana due to the obvious and non-lethal loss of anthocyanin accumulation upon widespread RNA silencing. Over-expression of CHS in the pap1-D background facilitated visual detection of both local and systemic RNA silencing. RNA silencing was initiated in leaf tissues from hpRNA and amiRNA plant expression vectors under the control of an Arabidopsis RuBisCo small subunit 1A promoter (SSU). In this system, hpRNA expression triggered CHS silencing in most leaf tissues but not in roots or seed coats. Similarly, 21-nt amiRNA expression from symmetric miRNA/miRNA* duplexes triggered CHS silencing in all leaf tissues but not in roots or seed coats. However, 22-nt amiRNA expression from an asymmetric duplex triggered CHS silencing in all tissues, including roots and seed coats, in the majority of plant lines. This widespread CHS silencing required RNA DEPENDENT RNA POLYMERASE6 mediated accumulation of phasiRNAs from the endogenous CHS transcript. These results demonstrate the efficacy of asymmetric 22-nt amiRNA-directed RNA silencing and associated phasiRNA production and activity, in mediating widespread RNA silencing of an endogenous target gene. Asymmetric 22-nt amiRNA directed RNA silencing requires little modification of existing amiRNA technology and is expected to be effective in suppressing other genes and/or members of gene families.

PRJNA215166	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Plants encode a general siRNA suppressor that is induced and suppressed by viruses	"Small RNAs play essential regulatory roles in genome stability, development and stress responses in most eukaryotes. Plants encode DICER-LIKE (DCL) RNaseIII enzymes, including DCL1, which produces miRNAs, and DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4, which produce diverse size classes of siRNA. Plants also encode RNASE THREE-LIKE (RTL) enzymes that lack DCL-specific domains and whose function is largely unknown. Small RNA sequencing in plants over-expressing RTL1 or RTL2 or lacking RTL2 revealed that RTL1 over-expression inhibits the accumulation of all types of small RNAs produced by DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4, indicating that RTL1 is a general suppressor of plant siRNA pathways. By contrast, RTL2 plays minor, if any, role in the small RNA repertoire. In vivo and in vitro assays revealed that RTL1 prevents siRNA production by degrading dsRNA before they are processed by DCL2, DCL3 and DCL4. The substrate of RTL1 cleavage is likely long perfect (or near-perfect) dsRNA, consistent with the RTL1-insensitivity of miRNAs, which derive from short imperfect dsRNA. RTL1 is naturally expressed only weakly in roots, but virus infection strongly induces its expression in leaves, suggesting that RTL1 induction is a general strategy used by viruses to counteract the siRNA-based plant antiviral defense. Accordingly, transgenic plants over-expressing RTL1 are more sensitive to TYMV infection than wild-type plants, likely because RTL1 prevents the production of antiviral siRNAs. However, TCV, TVCV and CMV, which encode stronger suppressors of RNA silencing (VSR) than TYMV, are insensitive to RTL1 over-expression. Indeed, TCV VSR inhibits RTL1 activity, suggesting that inducing RTL1 expression and dampening RTL1 activity is a dual strategy used by viruses to establish a successful infection. These results reveal another level of complexity in the evolutionary battle between viruses and plant defenses.

However, how different types of chromatin regulators individually control gene expression in different cell types has so far not been investigated in detail. To explore their role in these processes we performed forward and reverse genetic experiments using an epigenetically silenced reporter gene in Arabidopsis. We found three chromatin regulators, each involved in different epigenetic pathways, to control reporter gene expression in distinct tissues and cell-types. Here we report on the roles of the RNA polymerase Pol V, the histone deacetylase HDA6 and the SWI/SNF class chromatin remodeler SPLAYED (SYD) in silencing expression of the reporter in different cell-types. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a highly conserved domain in HDA6 is involved in its target specificity. And we present data showing that SYD controls transcription of epigenetically silenced genes. The results presented here provide evidence supporting the notion that tissue specificity of gene expression and its fine-tuning can be influenced by the activity of different chromatin regulators.

Until recently, insight into the chromosomal architecture of plants was mainly provided by cytogenetic studies. Complementary to these analyses, chromosome conformation technologies promise to refine and improve our view on chromosomal architecture and to provide a more generalised description of nuclear organization.  Results: Employing circular chromosome conformation capture (4C), this study describes chromosomal architecture in Arabidopsis nuclei from a genome-wide perspective. Surprisingly, the linear organisation of chromosomes is reflected in the genome-wide interactome. In addition, we studied the interplay of the interactome and epigenetic marks and report that the heterochromatic knob on the short arm of chromosome 4 (hk4s) maintained a pericentromere-like interaction profile and interactome despite its euchromatic surrounding.  Conclusion: Despite the extreme condensation that is necessary to pack the chromosomes into the nucleus, the Arabidopsis genome appears to be packed in a predictive manner, according to the following criteria:   (i) heterochromatin and euchromatin represent two distinct interactomes, (ii) interactions between chromosomes correlates with the linear position on the chromosome arm, and (iii) distal chromosome regions have a higher potential to interact with other chromosomes.
Overall design: This study includes circular chromosome conformation capture (4C) sequencing information of 13 samples, present in two batches, each present in duplicates (A and B).

Although widespread, few regulators of this process are known. The Arabidopsis thaliana protein FPA is a rare example of a trans-acting regulator of poly(A) site choice. Analysing fpa mutants therefore provides the opportunity to reveal generic consequences of disrupting this process. Here we show that specific chimeric RNAs formed between the exons of otherwise separate genes are a striking consequence of loss of FPA function. We also found that defective termination at specific loci in fpa mutants was shared with dicer-like (dcl)1 or dcl4 mutants, leading us to alternative explanations for some silencing roles of these proteins.

Methods: Arabidopsis buds mRNA profiles of anther development stages 5-6, 7-9, and 10-11 of the wild type (WT) and atcep1 mutant were generated by deep sequencing via Illumina HiSeqTM 2000. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were analyzed at the transcript isoform level with the following steps: Remove reads with adaptor sequences; Remove reads in which the percentage of unknown bases (N) is greater than 10%; Remove low quality reads, in which the percentage of the low quality base (base with quality value ≤ 5) is greater than 50%. The clean reads were mapped to the Arabidopsis reference genome and reference genes using SOAP aligner/SOAP2. No more than 2 mismatches were allowed in the alignment. The gene expression level was calculated using RPKM (Reads Per Kb per Million reads). Differential expression analysis between the wild type and the atcep1 mutant was performed using the DEGseq R package (1.12.0) based on normalized read counts.

However, to what extent histone variants control chromatin architecture remains largely unknown.  Here, we show that the previously uncharacterized histone variant H2A.W plays a crucial role in condensation of heterochromatin. Genome-wide profiling of all four types of H2A variants in Arabidopsis shows that H2A.W specifically associates with heterochromatin. H2A.W recruitment is independent of heterochromatic marks H3K9me2 and DNA methylation. Genetic interactions show that H2A.W acts in synergy with CMT3 mediated methylation to maintain genome integrity. In vitro, H2A.W enhances chromatin condensation through a higher propensity to make fiber-to-fiber interactions via its conserved C-terminal motif. In vivo, elimination of H2A.W causes decondensation of heterochromatin and conversely, ectopic expression of H2A.W promotes heterochromatin condensation. These results demonstrate that H2A.W plays critical roles in heterochromatin by promoting higher order chromatin condensation. Since similar H2A.W C-terminal motifs are present in other variant found in mammals and other organisms our findings impact our understanding of heterochromatin condensation in a wide variety of eukaryotic organisms.

PRJNA221223	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The Nuclear Immune Receptor RPS4 Is Required for RRS1SLH1-Dependent Constitutive Defense Activation in Arabidopsis thaliana.	"Plant nucleotide-binding leucine-rich repeat (NB-LRR) disease resistance (R) proteins recognize specific “avirulent” pathogen effectors and activate immune responses. NB-LRR proteins structurally and functionally resemble mammalian Nod-like receptors (NLRs). How NB-LRR and NLR proteins activate defense is poorly understood. The divergently transcribed Arabidopsis R genes, RPS4 (resistance to Pseudomonas syringae 4) and RRS1 (resistance to Ralstonia solanacearum 1), function together to confer recognition of Pseudomonas AvrRps4 and Ralstonia PopP2. RRS1 is the only known recessive NB-LRR R gene and encodes a WRKY DNA binding domain, prompting suggestions that it acts downstream of RPS4 for transcriptional activation of defense genes. We define here the early RRS1-dependent transcriptional changes upon delivery of PopP2 via Pseudomonas type III secretion. The Arabidopsis slh1 (sensitive to low humidity 1) mutant encodes an RRS1 allele (RRS1SLH1) with a single amino acid (leucine) insertion in the WRKY DNA-binding domain. Its poor growth due to constitutive defense activation is rescued at higher temperature. Transcription profiling data indicate that RRS1SLH1-mediated defense activation overlaps substantially with AvrRps4- and PopP2-regulated responses. To better understand the genetic basis of RPS4/RRS1-dependent immunity, we performed a genetic screen to identify suppressor of slh1 immunity (sushi) mutants. We show that many sushi mutants carry mutations in RPS4, suggesting that RPS4 acts downstream or in a complex with RRS1. Interestingly, several mutations were identified in a domain C-terminal to the RPS4 LRR domain. Using an Agrobacterium-mediated transient assay system, we demonstrate that the P-loop motif of RPS4 but not of RRS1SLH1 is required for RRS1SLH1 function. We also recapitulate the dominant suppression of RRS1SLH1 defense activation by wild type RRS1 and show this suppression requires an intact RRS1 P-loop. These analyses of RRS1SLH1 shed new light on mechanisms by which NB-LRR protein pairs activate defense signaling, or are held inactive in the absence of a pathogen effector.
Overall design: Arabidopsis No-0 and slh1 plants were grown for 4 weeks at 28°C after germination on MS plate. Plants were transferred to 19°C growth chamber at the beginning of the light cycle and samples were harvested at 0 h, 9 h, 12 h, 16 h and 24 h after transfer for total RNA extraction. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol.

PRJNA222364	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Non-CG methylation patterns shape the epigenetic landscape in Arabidopsis	"DNA methylation occurs in both CG and non-CG sequence contexts. Non-CG methylation is abundant in plants, and is mediated by CHROMOMETHYLASE (CMT) and DOMAINS REARRANGED METHYLTRANSFERASE (DRM) proteins; however its roles remain poorly understood. Here we characterize the roles of non-CG methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana. We show that a poorly characterized methyltransferase, CMT2, is a functional methyltransferase in vitro and in vivo. CMT2 specifically binds histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9) dimethylation and methylates non-CG cytosines at sites that are also regulated by H3K9 dimethylation. By generating different combinations of non-CG methylation mutants, we reveal the contributions and redundancies between each methyltransferase in DNA methylation patterning and in regulating transposable elements (TEs) and protein-coding genes. We also demonstrate extensive dependencies of small RNA accumulation and H3K9 methylation patterning on non-CG methylation, suggesting self-reinforcing mechanisms between these epigenetic factors. The results suggest that non-CG methylation patterns are critical in shaping the histone modification and small non-coding RNA landscapes.

PRJNA223529	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Natural Variation and Timing of Stress Responses Promote and Predict Heterosis	"Hybrid plants and animals grow larger and more vigorously than the parents, a common phenomenon known as hybrid vigor or heterosis. Heterosis often correlates with the genetic distance between hybridizing parents, but the mechanism for this is largely unknown. We found that genetic distance was correlated with natural variation of stress responses under the control of the circadian clock. CIRCADIAN-CLOCK-ASSOCIATED1 (CCA1) and LATE-ELONGATED-HYPOCOTYL (LHY) or CCA1 alone mediate expression amplitudes and periods of these stress-responsive genes in stress and non-stress conditions.  In Arabidopsis thaliana intraspecific hybrids, genome-wide expression of many biotic and abiotic stress-responsive genes was diurnally repressed to promote biomass heterosis, which is associated with several biomass quantitative trait loci (QTLs).  Expression differences in four selected stress-responsive genes among ten ecotypes could be used to predict heterosis in their hybrids.  Parent plants with larger expression differences between stress-responsive genes produced higher-vigor hybrids, while those with smaller differences produced lower-vigor hybrids.  Stress-responsive genes were epigenetically repressed in the hybrids under normal conditions but induced during times of stress at certain times of the day, balancing the tradeoff between stress responses and growth.  Consistently, repressing the stress genes in diploids increased growth vigor.  We demonstrate how hybrids manipulate diurnal stress-responsive gene expression to enhance growth vigor.  Both circadian and epigenetic regulation play key roles in the altered expression of stress-responsive genes in hybrids.  Our findings provide a conceptual advance and mechanistic understanding of heterosis, as well as selection criteria for parents to be effectively used for producing high-yield hybrids.

PRJNA224705	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)EXPRSS: an Illumina based high-throughput expression-profiling method to reveal transcriptional dynamics - II	"Background
Next Generation Sequencing technologies have facilitated differential gene expression analysis through RNA-seq and Tag-seq methods. RNA-seq has biases associated with transcript lengths, lacks uniform coverage of regions in mRNA and requires 10–20 times more reads than a typical Tag-seq. Most existing Tag-seq methods either have biases or not high throughput due to use of restriction enzymes or enzymatic manipulation of 5’ ends of mRNA or use of RNA ligations.
Results
We have developed EXpression Profiling through Randomly Sheared cDNA tag Sequencing (EXPRSS) that employs acoustic waves to randomly shear cDNA and generate sequence tags at a relatively defined position (~150-200 bp) from the 3′ end of each mRNA. Implementation of the method was verified through comparative analysis of expression data generated from EXPRSS, NlaIII-DGE and Affymetrix microarray and through qPCR quantification of selected genes. EXPRSS is a strand specific and restriction enzyme independent tag sequencing method that does not require cDNA length-based data transformations. EXPRSS is highly reproducible, is high-throughput and it also reveals alternative polyadenylation and polyadenylated antisense transcripts. It is cost-effective using barcoded multiplexing, avoids the biases of existing SAGE and derivative methods and can reveal polyadenylation position from paired-end sequencing.
Conclusions
EXPRSS Tag-seq provides sensitive and reliable gene expression data and enables high-throughput expression profiling with relatively simple downstream analysis.
Overall design: Five weeks old Arabidopsis (Col-0, ein2-5, jar1-1 and npr1-1) leaf discs treated with water or flg22 and a time course of samples were collected; mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS protocols.

PRJNA224965	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis EDM2 Promotes IBM1 Distal Polyadenylation and Regulates Genome DNA Methylation Patterns [RNA-Seq]	"A forward genetics screen led to the identification of the putative chromatin regulator EDM2 as a cellular anti-silencing factor and regulator of genome DNA methylation patterns. EDM2 contains a composite PHD finger domain that recognizes both active H3K4 and repressive H3K9 methylation marks at the intronic repeat elements in genes such as the histone H3K9 demethylase gene IBM1, and is necessary for maintaining the expression of these genes by promoting mRNA distal polyadenylation. Because of its role in maintaining IBM1 expression, EDM2 is required for preventing CHG methylation in the bodies of thousands of genes.Our results thus increase the understanding of anti-silencing, genome methylation patterns, and regulation of alternative RNA processing by intronic heterochromatin.

PRJNA225010	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Interactions of ARF6 with PIF4, BZR1, and RGA integrate auxin signaling with environmental and other hormonal signals in Arabidopsis [RNA-Seq]	"Auxin is a major plant hormone for both development and environmental adaptation. Auxin responses are context dependent and highly modulated by light, temperature, the circadian clock, brassinosteroid, and gibberellin, but the underlying mechanisms remain unclear. Here, we show that auxin signaling integrates with other signals through direct interactions of AUXIN RESPONSE FACTOR6 (ARF6) with PHYTOCHROME INTERACTING FACTOR4 (PIF4), the brassinosteroid-signaling transcription factor BZR1, and the gibberellin-signaling repressor RGA.  ChIP-Seq and RNA-Seq experiments show that ARF6, PIF4, and BZR1 bind to largely overlapping targets in the genome and synergistically activate gene expression. In vitro and in vivo assays show that ARF6-promoter binding is enhanced by PIF4 and BZR1 but blocked by RGA. Furthermore, a tripartite HLH/bHLH module feedback regulates PIF activity and thus modulates auxin sensitivity according to additional developmental and environmental cues. Our results demonstrate a central growth-regulation transcriptional network that coordinates hormonal, environmental, and developmental control of cell elongation and plant growth.

PRJNA226579	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)SRA/SET domain-containing proteins link RNA polymerase V occupancy to DNA methylation	"RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) in Arabidopsis thaliana depends on the  synthesis of non-coding RNAs by nuclear RNA polymerase E (NRPE or Pol V) 1-3, but the mechanism by which Pol V is targeted is unknown. Here we show that genome-wide Pol V association with chromatin redundantly requires the  SU(VAR)3-9 homologs, SUVH2 and SUVH9. These proteins resemble histone  methyltransferases, however a crystal structure reveals that SUVH9 lacks a peptide-substrate binding cleft and lacks a properly formed S-Adenosyl methionine (SAM) binding pocket necessary for normal catalysis, consistent with a lack of methyltransferase activity for these proteins. SUVH2 and SUVH9 both contain SET- and RING-ASSOCIATED (SRA) domains capable of binding methylated DNA, suggesting that they function to recruit Pol V through DNA methylation. Consistent with this model, mutation of the DNA METHYLTRANSFERASE 1, MET1, causes losses of DNA methylation, a nearly complete loss of Pol V at its normal locations, and redistribution of Pol V to sites that become hypermethylated. By tethering SUVH2 with a zinc finger to an unmethylated epiallele of the homeodomain transcription factor FWA, we demonstrate that SUVH2 is sufficient to both recruit Pol V and establish DNA methylation and gene silencing. Our results suggest that Pol V is recruited to DNA methylation through the methyl-DNA binding SUVH2 and SUVH9 proteins, and our mechanistic findings suggest a means for selectively targeting regions of the plant genome for epigenetic silencing.
Overall design: For wild type plants (ecotype Columbia) and suvh2 suvh9 double mutants whole-genome small RNA (sRNA-seq) and bisulfite sequencing (BS-seq) was performed. For the small RNA sequencing nrpd1 and nrpe1 mutant plants were sequenced in parallel as controls. For the bisulfite sequencing data, the wildtype data and that of the suvh2 and suvh9 single mutants was previously published and is thus not submitted here. In addition, two replicates of whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP-seq) was performed on wild type (ecotype Columbia) plants as a negative control with experimentals consiting of wildtype and suvh2 suvh9 mutant plants carrying a C-terminally epitope tagged (3XFLAG) NRPE1. Whole genome ChIP seq was also performed using a gifted endogenous NRPE1 antibody in a wildtype and met1 mutant background. Whole-genome bisulfite sequencing was also performed on fwa-4 epiallele plants transformed with the wild-type SUVH2 protein-coding construct containing a tethering zinc finger targeted to repeats at the fwa gene. For these transgenic libraries a line carrying a FLAG and fwa targeting zinc-finger tagged KRYPTONITE methyltransferase was bisulfite sequenced as a control (“FLAG-ZF-KYP”). Less..."

PRJNA227304	Boechera gunnisonianaCell-type specific transcriptome analysis to study germline development and reproduction in apomictic Boechera gunnisoniana - Individual cell types	Apomixis differs from sexual reproduction only in three major aspects: While the sexual megaspore mother cell undergoes meiosis, the apomictic initial cell omits or aborts meiosis (apomeiosis); the unreduced egg cell of apomicts forms an embryo without fertilization (parthenogenesis), and formation of functional endosperm requires specific developmental adaptations. Currently, our knowledge about the gene regulatory programs underlying apomixis is scarce. We used the apomict Boechera gunnisoniana, a close relative of Arabidopsis thaliana, to investigate the transcriptional basis underlying apomeiosis and parthenogenesis. Here, we present the first comprehensive reference transcriptome for reproductive development in an apomictic species. To compare sexual and apomictic development at the cellular level, we then used a combination of laser-assisted microdissection with microarray and RNA-Seq analysis. Our study yields important new insights into the transcriptional basis underlying apomixis. Less...

PRJNA227546	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization	The spatial arrangement of interphase chromosomes in the nucleus is important for gene expression and genome function in animals and in plants. The recently developed Hi-C technology is an efficacious method to investigate genome packing. Here we present a detailed Hi-C map of the three-dimensional genome organization of the plant Arabidopsis thaliana. We find that local chromatin packing differs from the patterns seen in animals, with kilobasepair-sized segments that have much higher intra-chromosome interaction rates than neighboring regions and which represent a dominant local structural feature of genome conformation in A. thaliana. These regions appear as positive strips on two-dimensional representations of chromatin interaction and they are enriched in epigenetic marks H3K27me3, H3.1 and H3.3. We also identify over 400 insulator-like regions. Furthermore, although topologically associating domains (TADs), which are prominent in animals, are not the dominant feature of A. thaliana genome packing, we found over 1,000 regions that have properties of TAD boundaries, and a similar number of regions similar to the interior of TADs. These insulator-like, TAD-boundary-like, and TAD-interior-like regions show strong enrichment for distinct epigenetic marks, and correlate with gene transcription levels. We conclude that epigenetic modifications, gene density, and transcriptional activity all contribute to shaping the local structure of the A. thaliana nuclear genome. Less...

Meanwhile, it is not clear how the risk of expansive PTGS from endogenous genes featured by transitive siRNA production is minimized. Here we demonstrate two essential components of the SKI complex in cytoplasmic 3’-5’ mRNA decay pathway, SKI2 and SKI3, function as negative regulators of transgene PTGS in Arabidopsis. The ski2 mutants manifested severe synthetic phenotypes with a 5’-3’ exoribonuclease mutant, ein5, which were substantially suppressed by the PTGS mutants, rdr6 and ago1. RDR6 is essential for the altered gene expression in ein5 ski2 on a transcriptome-wide scale. mRNA-seq approach was used to investigate the physiological relevance veiled by the myriad developmental phenotypes in Col-0 (C), ein5-1 (e), ski2-3 (s), ein5-1 ski2-3 (es), rdr6-11 (r) and rdr6-11 ein5-1 ski2-3 (res). Compared with Col-0, 4394 genes exhibited differential expression in ein5-1 ski2-3, much more than those in the ein5-1 (1138 genes) or ski2-3 (1040 genes) single mutant (2-fold cutoff, p < 0.01, FDR < 0.05), suggesting a largely disturbed transcriptome in the absence of both EIN5 and SKI2. While a small overlap was found between the differentially expressed genes in e/C and s/C comparisons, the gene lists from es/C, es/e and es/s comparisons (2-fold cutoff, p < 0.01, FDR < 0.05) largely overlapped with each other, indicating a collaborative function of EIN5 and SKI2 on a transcriptome-wide scale. The 1670 genes overlapped in the es/C, es/e and es/s comparisons included 1306 upregulated genes and 360 downregulated genes with only 4 genes as exception. 994 of the 1306 upregulated genes (76.1%) and 273 of the 360 downregulated genes (75.8%) were differentially expressed in the es/res comparison like that in es/C, es/e and es/s, indicating a substantial supression of the redundant function of EIN5 and SKI2 by RDR6.

Since the epigenetic modification of TEs can vary within species, we investigated intraspecific variation in imprinting, coupled with analysis of DNA methylation and small RNAs, among three strains of Arabidopsis that display diverse seed size phenotypes. Unexpectedly we found that one strain, Cvi, is globally CG hypomethylated. We discovered three examples of strain-specific imprinting caused by epigenetic variation at a TE. Our data allowed us to predict and experimentally validate an instances of allele-specific imprinting in additional strains based only on methylation patterns. We conclude that numerous differences in imprinting can evolve in highly similar, recently diverged genotypes due to epiallelic variation present within the species. Our data demonstrate that epiallelic variation and genomic imprinting intersect to produce novel gene expression patterns in seeds.

An antagonistic interaction has been observed between the growth-promoting hormone brassinosteroid and pathogen associated molecular pattern (PAMP) signals, which induce immunity but inhibit growth, however the underlying molecular mechanism has remained unclear. The PRE-IBH1-HBI1 triple helix-loop-helix/basic helix-loop-helix (HLH/bHLH) cascade has been shown to mediate growth responses to several hormonal and environmental signals, but its downstream targets and role in immunity remain unknown. Here, we performed genome-wide analyses of HBI1 target genes in Arabidopsis. The results show that HBI1 regulates a set of genes that largely overlaps with targets of PIFs, but displays both similar and unique transcriptional activities compared to PIFs, supporting a role in fine-tuning the network through cooperation and antagonism with other DNA-binding factors of the network. Furthermore, HBI1 also negatively regulates a subset of defense response genes. Two PAMPs, flagellin and elongation factor, repressed HBI1 expression, whereas overexpression of HBI1 reduced the PAMP-induced growth inhibition, defense gene expression, reactive oxygen species (ROS) production, and flg22-induced resistance to Pseudomonas syringae pathovar tomato DC3000. These data indicate that HBI1 is a node for crosstalk between hormone and immune pathways. This study demonstrates that the PRE-IBH1-HBI1 module integrates hormone and pathogen signals, and thus plays a central role in the balance between growth and immunity in plants.

Deregulated parent-of-origin specific genes are causal for the response to interploidy hybridizations, revealing an epigenetic basis of this phenomenon. In this study we present evidence that paternal hypomethylation can bypass the interploidy hybridization barrier by alleviating the requirement of the epigenetic Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 (PRC2) in the endosperm. Bypass of the barrier is mediated by suppressed expression of imprinted genes.

PRJNA232536	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Expression profiling during arabidopsis/downy mildew interaction reveals a highly-expressed effector that attenuates responses to salicylic acid.	"Plants have evolved strong innate immunity mechanisms, but successful pathogens evade or suppress plant immunity via effectors delivered into the plant cell. Hyaloperonospora arabidopsidis (Hpa) causes downy mildew on Arabidopsis thaliana, and a genome sequence is available for isolate Emoy2. Here, we exploit the availability of genome sequences for Hpa and Arabidopsis to measure gene-expression changes in both Hpa and Arabidopsis simultaneously during infection. Using a high-throughput cDNA tag sequencing method, we reveal expression patterns of Hpa predicted effectors and Arabidopsis genes in compatible and incompatible interactions, and promoter elements associated with Hpa genes expressed during infection. By resequencing Hpa isolate Waco9, we found it evades Arabidopsis resistance gene RPP1 through deletion of the cognate recognized effector ATR1. Arabidopsis salicylic acid (SA)-responsive genes including PR1 were activated not only at early time points in the incompatible interaction but also at late time points in the compatible interaction. By histochemical analysis, we found that Hpa suppresses SA-inducible PR1 expression, specifically in the haustoriated cells into which host-translocated effectors are delivered, but not in non-haustoriated adjacent cells. Finally, we found a highly-expressed Hpa effector candidate that suppresses responsiveness to SA. As this approach can be easily applied to host-pathogen interactions for which both host and pathogen genome sequences are available, this work opens the door towards transcriptome studies in infection biology that should help unravel pathogen infection strategies and the mechanisms by which host defense responses are overcome.
Overall design: Three weeks old Arabidopsis (Col-0) plants were inoculated with either the avirulent isolate Emoy2 (incompatible interaction) or the virulent isolate Waco9 (compatible interaction) of Hpa, and infected plants were harvested at 1, 3 and 5 days post-inoculation (dpi) for total RNA extraction. mRNA profiles were generated by deep sequencing on Illumina GAIIx using EXPRSS tag-seq protocol. Each biological replicate set of samples were sequenced as one batch (biorep1, biorep2 and biorep3 in filenames) and each batch was sequenced in 4 individual Illumina flowcell lanes (lane1 to lane4 in filenames). Four sequecing lanes of each three biological repliates resulted in 12 sequencing libraries.

PRJNA232638	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)3’ and 5’ end modifications in plant microRNA post biogenesis: evidences from NGS of small RNAs [Arabidopsis thaliana]	"Backgropund:In a major paradigm shift in the last decade, the knowledge about a whole class of non-coding RNAs known as miRNAs has emerged, which have proved these to be important regulators of a wide range of cellular processes by the way of modulation of gene expression. It is reported that some of these miRNAs are modified by addition or deletion of nucleotides at their ends, after biogenesis. However, the biogenesis and functions of these modifications are not well studied in eukaryotes, especially in plants. In this study, we examined the miRNA modifications in different tissues of the various plants, namely rice, tomato and Arabidopsis and identified some common features of such modifications.
Results:We have analyzed different aspects of miRNA modifications in plants. To achieve this end, we developed a PERL script to find the modifications in the sequences using small RNA deep sequencing data. The modification occurs in both mature and passenger (star) strands, as well as at both the 5' and 3' ends of miRNAs. Interestingly, we found a position-specific nucleotide biased modification, as evident by increased number of modification at the 5' end with the presence of Cytosine (nucleotide 'C') at the 3’end of the miRNA sequence. The level of modifications is not strictly dependent on the abundance of miRNA. Our study showed that the modification events are independent of plant species, tissue and physiological conditions. Our analysis also indicates that the RNAi enzyme, namely, the RNA dependent RNA polymerase 6 (RDR6) may not have any role in Arabidopsis miRNA modifications. Some of these modified miRNAs are bound to AGO1, suggesting their possible roles in biological processes.
Conclusions:This is a first report that reveals that 5' nucleotide additions are preferred for mature miRNA sequences with 3’ terminal ‘C’ nucleotide. Our analysis also indicates that the miRNAs modifications involving addition of nucleotides to the 5’ or 3’ end are independent of RDR6 activity and are not restricted by plant species, physiological conditions and tissue types. The results also indicate that such modifications might be important for biological processes.

PRJNA230112	Poly(A)-tail profiling reveals an embryonic switch in translational control	"Poly(A) tails enhance the stability and translation of most eukaryotic messenger RNAs, but difficulties in globally measuring poly(A)-tail lengths have impeded greater understanding of poly(A)-tail function. Here we describe poly(A)-tail length profiling by sequencing (PAL-seq) and apply it to measure tail lengths of millions of individual RNAs isolated from yeasts, cell lines, Arabidopsis thaliana leaves, mouse liver, and zebrafish and frog embryos. Poly(A)-tail lengths were conserved between orthologous mRNAs, with mRNAs encoding ribosomal proteins and other 'housekeeping' proteins tending to have shorter tails. As expected, tail lengths were coupled to translational efficiencies in early zebrafish and frog embryos. However, this strong coupling diminished at gastrulation and was absent in non-embryonic samples, indicating a rapid developmental switch in the nature of translational control. This switch complements an earlier switch to zygotic transcriptional control and explains why the predominant effect of microRNA mediated deadenylation concurrently shifts from translational repression to mRNA destabilization.

PRJNA237334	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Transcriptional gene silencing by Arabidopsis Microrchidia homologues involves the formation of heteromers	"Epigenetic gene silencing is of central importance to maintain genome integrity and is mediated by an elaborate interplay between DNA methylation, histone posttranslational modifications and chromatin remodeling complexes. DNA methylation and repressive histone marks usually correlate with transcriptionally silent heterochromatin, however there are exceptions to this interdependence. In Arabidopsis, mutation of MORPHEUS MOLECULE 1 (MOM1) causes transcriptional derepression of heterochromatin independently of changes in DNA methylation. More recently, two Arabidopsis homologs of mouse Microrchidia (MORC) have also been implicated in gene silencing and heterochromatin condensation without altering genome-wide DNA methylation patterns. In this study, we show that AtMORC6 physically interacts with AtMORC1 and with its close homologue AtMORC2 in two mutually exclusive protein complexes. RNA-seq analysis of high-order mutants indicates that AtMORC1 and AtMORC2 act redundantly to repress a common set of loci. We also examined the genetic interactions between AtMORC6 and MOM1 pathways. Although AtMORC6 and MOM1 control the silencing of a very similar set of genomic loci, we observed synergistic transcriptional regulation in the mom1/atmorc6 double mutant, suggesting that these epigenetic regulators act mainly by independent silencing mechanisms.
Overall design: RNA-seq libraries were prepared for two suites of mutants to allow direct comparisons between mutants within each set. The two sets consisted of the following samples: Set_1) A wildtype (Col) control, the morc1 mutant, the morc2 mutant, the morc1 morc2 double mutant, the morc6 mutant, and the morc1 morc2 morc6 triple mutant ; Set_2) A wildtpe (Col) control, the morc6 mutant, the mom1 mutant, and the mom1 morc6 double mutant.

PRJNA240248	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)SKIP Confers Salt Tolerance through Controlling Gene Alternative Splicing in Arabidopsis	"A better understanding of the mechanisms for plant in response to abiotic stresses is key for the improvement of plant to resistant to the stresses. Much has been known for the regulation of gene expression in response to salt stress at transcriptional level, however, little is known at posttranscriptional level for this response. Recently, we identified that SKIP is a component of spliceosome and is necessary for the regulation of alternative splicing and mRNA maturation of clock genes. In this study, we observed that skip-1 is hypersensitive to salt stress. SKIP is necessary for the alternative splicing and mRNA maturation of several salt tolerance genes, e.g. NHX1, CBL1, P5CS1, RCI2A, and PAT10. Genome-wide analysis reveals that SKIP mediates the alternative splicing of many genes under salt stress condition, most of the new alternative splicing events in skip-1 is intron retention, which leads to the premature termination codon in their mRNA. SKIP also controls the alternative splicing by modulating the recognition or cleavage of 5' and 3' splice donor and acceptor sites under salt stress condition. Therefore, this study addresses a fundamental question on how the mRNA splicing machinery contributes to salt response at a posttranscriptional level.

In addition to global principles of chromatin organisation, we describe a novel nuclear structure, termed KNOT, in which genomic regions of all five Arabidopsis chromosomes highly interact. These regions are characterized as heterochromatic islands within the euchromatin and likely represent preferred landing sites for transposons, suggesting a novel transposon defence mechanism in the Arabidopsis nucleus.

Methods: Total mRNA of 10 day wild-type Arabidopsis seedlings that were treated with and without flg22( final concentrations 1μmol/L) in 1/2 MS medium for 4h, were extracted respectively. Each sample was harvested in three independent biological replicates with equal weight and mixed ,subsequently sequencing. The sequence reads that passed quality filters were mapped to the Arabidopsis_thaliana genome (TAIR10.18).Then the mapping genes were used for the abundance and functional analysis.
Results: We mapped about 45 million and 52 million sequence reads of control sample and treatment sample to the Arabidopsis_thaliana  genome (TAIR10.18) and identified total 23,413 genes with Botiw/TopHat workflow. Comparison of the two samples showed 1,200 differentially expressed genes (DEGs), including 290 down-regulated and 910 up-regulated genes. The DEGs were associated with energy metabolism, amino acid metabolism and biosynthesis of secondary metabolites. After flg22 treatment, genes involved in indolic glucosinolate biosynthesis pathway were up-regulated significantly，which is further demonstrated by Real Time RT-PCR, while aliphatic glucosinolate pathway almost had no change,  indicating the important role of indolic glucosinolates in plant defense responses.
Conclusion: Our study provides the overall genetic resource of Arabidopsis_thaliana after treated by flg22 to date. These data will pave the way for further studies about deeply understand pathogen induced defense and the contribution of indolic glucosinolates.

PRJNA244365	Perturbation of parent-specific gene expression during interspecific hybridization	"Interspecific hybridization often induces epigenetic remodeling that leads to transposon activation, gene expression changes, and loss of imprinting. These genomic changes can be deleterious and lead to postzygotic hybrid incompatibility. In Arabidopsis, loss of genomic imprinting of PHERES1 and presumed failure of Polycomb Repressive Complex is partially responsible for seed inviability observed in A. thaliana X A. arenosa interspecific hybrids. We used this species pair to further analyze the relationship between parent-specific gene expression and postzygotic hybrid incompatibility using two A. thaliana ecotypes, Col-0 and C24, with differential seed survival. We found that maternal imprinting was perturbed for PHERES1, HDG3, and six other genes in both A. thaliana hybrids and paternal imprinting was lost for MEDEA as observed previously. Three classes of retroelements; Sadhu, Athila, and Copia, maintained proper repression patterns suggesting some regulatory mechanisms are not disrupted early in development. We propose that early genome remodeling and loss of imprinting of seed development genes induces lethality in both compatible and incompatible hybrids.

MicroProteins have been identified in plants and animals, where they are mostly involved in the regulation of developmental processes. Here we show that two Arabidopsis thaliana microProteins, miP1a and miP1b, physically interact with CONSTANS (CO) a potent regulator of flowering time. The miP1a/b-type microProteins evolved in dicotyledonous plants and have an additional carboxy-terminal PF(V/L)FL motif. This motif enables miP1a/b microProteins to interact with TOPLESS/TOPLESS-RELATED (TPL/TPR) proteins. Interaction of CO with miP1a/b/TPL causes late flowering due to a failure in the induction of FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT) expression under inductive long day conditions. Both miP1a and miP1b are expressed in vascular tissue, where CO and FT are active. Genetically, miP1a/b act upstream of CO thus our findings unravel a novel layer of flowering time regulation via microProtein-inhibition.

PRJNA242702	Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana strain:Col-0 Transcriptome or Gene expression	When grown under phosphate (Pi) deficiency, plants adjust their developmental program and metabolic activity to cope with this nutritional stress. For Arabidopsis, the developmental responses include inhibition of primary root growth and enhanced formation of lateral roots and root hairs. Pi deficiency also inhibits photosynthesis by suppressing the expression of photosynthetic genes. Interestingly, early studies showed that photosynthetic gene expression was also suppressed in roots, a non-photosynthetic tissue. The biological relevance of this phenomenon, however, is not known. In this work, we characterized an Arabidopsis mutant, hps7, which is hypersensitive to Pi deficiency; the hypersensitivity includes an increased inhibition of root growth. HPS7 encodes a tyrosylprotein sulfotransferase (TPST). Accumulation of TPST proteins, but not mRNA, is induced by Pi deficiency. Comparative RNA-Seq analyses indicated that expression of many photosynthetic genes was activated in the roots of hps7. Under Pi deficiency, the expression of the photosynthetic genes in hps7 is further increased, which leads to the enhanced accumulation of chlorophyll, starch, and reactive oxygen species. The increased inhibition of root growth in hps7 under Pi deficiency was completely reversed by growing plants in the dark. Based on these results, we propose that suppression of photosynthetic gene expression in roots is required for sustained root growth under Pi deficiency. Less...

PRJNA245920	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Detection of Pol IV-dependent transcripts at the genomic scale in Arabidopsis reveals features and regulation of siRNA biogenesis	"24 nucleotide siRNAs are central players in RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM), a process that establishes DNA methylation at transposable elements to ensure genome stability. The plant-specific RNA polymerase IV (Pol IV) is required for siRNA biogenesis and is thought to transcribe RdDM loci to produce primary transcripts that serve as precursors to siRNAs. Yet, no such transcripts have ever been reported. Here, through RNA sequencing and double-stranded RNA sequencing in genotypes that compromise the dicing of siRNA precursors, we were able to identify Pol IV-dependent transcripts from tens of thousands of loci. We show that Pol IV-dependent transcripts correspond to both DNA strands, while the Pol II-dependent transcripts produced upon de-repression of the loci are derived from primarily one strand. We show that Pol IV-dependent transcripts have a 5’ monophosphate, lack a polyA tail at the 3’ end, and contain no introns; these features distinguish them from Pol II-dependent transcripts. Moreover, RDR2 is shown to play similar roles with Pol IV in both the abundance of siRNA precursors and siRNAs as well as the CHH DNA methylation. The decreased CHH methylation at dcl234 can inhibit the transcription of Pol IV at DRM2-target sites. Finally, the regulations of siRNA biogenesis were explored.

PRJEB1773	Identification of nucleosome depleted regions in Arabidopsis thaliana during oxidative stress	FAIRE is a procedure allowing the isolation of nucleosome-depleted regions from eukaryotic chromatin. With FAIRE different chromosomal regions are cross-linked to formaldehyde with different efficiencies, depending on the openness of the chromatin and their bound proteins.  FAIRE has  been employed to discover gene expression regulatory elements in a genome-wide scale.  Such regions of the chromatin can be straightforwardly isolated using a simple biochemical phenol-chloroform extraction procedure after formaldehyde-mediated crosslinking of histones to chromosomal DNA and random fragmentation of the DNA by sonication. The extracted genomic DNA fragments are generally free of histones and represent regions containing regulatory elements, to which transcription factors could bind. Such genome segments can be further sequenced by next generation sequence technologies and thus identified. We established the FAIRE method for the analysis of regulatory elements in Arabidopsis. We used FAIRE on seedlings treated with 1mM 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole (3-AT) which inhibits catalase, thus leading to an intracellular rise in H2O2 level. FAIRE-isolated genomic fragments were subjected to deep sequencing resulting in around 100 million paired-end reads per sample (control and 3-AT-treated). Less...	
PRJNA246543	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The arf10/16 double mutant has a differential transcriptional program in response to Al stress	"To reveal how ARF10 and ARF16 regulate Al-induced root-growth inhibition, a transcriptome analysis was carried out by comparing without and with Al-exposed arf10/16 double mutant line and WT through RNA sequencing. The present transcriptomic analysis has revealed that many of the differentially transcribed genes associated with cell wall modification were regulated by transcription factors ARF10 and ARF16. The implication is that the auxin-regulated Al-induced inhibition of root growth arises from auxin signalling-regulated cell wall structure or component modification.

PRJNA247731	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide analysis of PAPS1-dependent polyadenylation identifies novel roles for functionally specialized poly(A) polymerases in Arabidopsis thaliana	"The poly(A) tail at 3' ends of eukaryotic mRNAs promotes their nuclear export, stability and translational efficiency, and changes in its length can strongly impact gene expression. The Arabidopsis thaliana genome encodes three canonical nuclear poly(A) polymerases, PAPS1, PAPS2 and PAPS4. As shown by their different mutant phenotypes, these three isoforms are functionally specialized, with PAPS1 modifying organ growth and suppressing a constitutive immune response. However, the molecular basis of this specialization is largely unknown. Here, we have estimated poly(A)-tail lengths on a transcriptome-wide scale in wild-type and paps1 mutants. This identified categories of genes as particularly strongly affected in paps1 mutants, including genes encoding ribosomal proteins, cell-division factors and major carbohydrate-metabolic proteins. We experimentally verified two novel functions of PAPS1 in ribosome biogenesis and redox homoeostasis that were predicted based on the analysis of poly(A)-tail length changes in paps1 mutants. When overlaying the PAPS1-dependent effects observed here with coexpression analysis based on independent microarray data, the two clusters of transcripts that are most closely coexpressed with PAPS1 show the strongest change in poly(A)-tail length and transcript abundance in paps1 mutants in our analysis. This suggests that their coexpression reflects at least partly the preferential polyadenylation of these transcripts by PAPS1 versus the other two poly(A)-polymerase isoforms. Thus, transcriptomewide analysis of poly(A)-tail lengths identifies novel biological functions and likely target transcripts for polyadenylation by PAPS1. Data integration with large-scale coexpression data suggests that changes in the relative activities of the isoforms are used as an endogenous mechanism to co-ordinately modulate plant gene expression.

PRJNA248026	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	DNA methylation is an important epigenetic modification involved in many biologcial processes, and active DNA demethylation plays critical roles in regulating expression of genes and anti-silencing of transgenes. In this study, we isolated mutations in one arabidopsis gene, ROS5, which causes the silencing of transgenic 35S-NPTII because of DNA hypermethylation, but no effect on transgenic RD29A-LUC. ROS5 encodes an atypical small heat shock protein. ROS5 can physically interact with IDM1 and is required for preventing DNA hypermethylation of some endogenous genes that are also regualated by IDM1 and ROS1. We propose that ROS5 may regulate active DNA demethylation by interacting with IDM1, thereby creating a friendly chromatin environment that facilitates the binding of ROS1 to erase DNA methylation.

In higher plants, the initiation and proliferation of stomatal stem cells is controlled by the basic helix-loop-helix transcription factor SPEECHLESS (SPCH). The stomatal stem cells and SPCH, which represent an innovation in seed plants, allow flexibility in the production of stomata, but how SPCH generates these stem cells is unclear. Here, we developed a highly sensitive chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assay and profiled the cell-type specific genome-wide targets of Arabidopsis SPCH in vivo. We found that SPCH directly controls key and novel regulators that drive cell fate and asymmetric cell divisions and enhances responsiveness to cell-cell communication.

PRJNA248877	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The photoreceptor chaperone FHY1 has an independent role in gene modulation and plant development under far-red light [RNA-Seq]	"To incorporate the far-red light (FR) signal into a strategy for optimizing plant growth, FAR-RED ELONGATED HYPOCOTYL1 (FHY1) mediates the nuclear translocation of the FR photoreceptor phytochrome A (phyA) and facilitates the association of phyA with the promoters of numerous associated genes crucial for the response to environmental stimuli. However, whether FHY1 plays additional roles following FR irradiation remains elusive. Here, by the global identification of FHY1 chromatin association sites through ChIP-seq analysis and by the comparison of FHY1-associated sites with phyA- associated sites, we demonstrated that nuclear FHY1 can either act independently of phyA or act in association with phyA to activate the expression of distinct  target genes. We also determined that phyA can act independently of FHY1 in regulating phyA-specific target genes. Furthermore, we determined that the independent FHY1 nuclear pathway is involved in crucial developmental aspects, as in the case of inhibited seed germination under FR during salt-stress. Notably, the differential presence of cis-elements and transcription factors in common and unique FHY1 and/or phyA associated genes are indicative of the complexity of the independent and coordinated FHY1 and phyA pathways. Our study uncovers new aspects of FHY1 function beyond its currently recognized role in phyA-dependent photomorphogenesis

Here, we performed a genome-wide identification of phyA targets using a combination of phyA ChIP- and RNA-sequencing methods. Our results indicate that the phyA signaling widely impact gene promoters involved in multiple FR-modulated aspects of plant growth. Furthermore, there was an enrichment of hormones- and stresses-responsive elements in the phyA direct target promoters, indicating that a much broader than expected range of transcription factors are involved in the phyA signaling. To verify our hypothesis that phyA regulates genes other than light-responsive ones through interaction with corresponding transcription factors, we examined the phyA action on one of its direct target gene NAC019, encoding an ABAdependent transcription factor. The phyA signaling cascade, consisting of FHY1 and HY5, not only targets two G-boxes on NAC019 promoter for subsequent transcriptional regulation, but also positively coordinates with ABA response for the root elongation inhibition under FR. Our study provides new insights into how plants rapidly fine-tune their growth strategy upon dynamic light environment by escorting photoreceptors to the promoters of hormones- or stresses-responsive genes for individualized modulation.

Likewise, few endogenous mechanisms of antibiotic resistance have been reported. The Arabidopsis thaliana ATP Binding Cassette (ABC) transporter AtWBC19 (ABCG19) is known to confer kanamycin resistance, but the exact mechanism of resistance is not well understood. Here we examined the transcriptomes of control seedlings and wbc19 mutant seedlings using RNA-seq analysis. Exposure to kanamycin indicated changes in the organization of the photosynthetic apparatus, metabolic fluxes and metal uptake. Elemental analysis showed a 60% and 80% reduction of iron uptake in control and wbc19 mutant seedlings respectively, upon exposure to kanamycin. The drop in iron content was accompanied by the upregulation of the gene encoding for FERRIC REDUCTION OXIDASE 6 (FRO6) in mutant seedlings but not by the differential expression of other transport genes known to be induced by iron deficiency. In addition, wbc19 mutants displayed a distinct expression profile in the absence of kanamycin. Most notably, the expression of several zinc ion binding proteins, including ZINC TRANSPORTER 1 PRECURSOR (ZIP1), was increased, suggesting abnormal zinc uptake. Elemental analysis confirmed a 50% decrease of zinc content in wbc19 mutants. Thus, the antibiotic resistance gene WBC19 appears to also have a role in zinc uptake.

Long term maintenance of an active root meristem requires that the generation of new root meristem cells and the loss of cells from the meristem due to differentiation is precisely coordinated. Via phenotypic and large scale transcriptome analyses of mutants, we show that the signalling peptide CLE40 and the receptor proteins CLV2 and CRN act in two genetically separable pathways that antagonistically regulate cell differentiation in the proximal root meristem. CLE40 inhibits cell differentiation throughout the primary root meristem by controlling genes with roles in abscisic acid, auxin and cytokinin signalling. CRN and CLV2 jointly control target genes that promote cell differentiation specifically in the transition zone of the proximal root meristem. While CRN and CLV2 are not acting in the CLE40 signaling pathway under normal growth conditions, both proteins are required when the levels of CLE40 or related CLE peptides increase. We show here that two antagonistically acting pathways controlling root meristem differentiation can be activated by the same peptide in a dosage dependent manner.

Methods: Total RNA was extracted from two biological replicates from both wild-type and stk mutant inflorescences and siliques until 5 DAP with the Qiagen Kit according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA contaminations were removed using the PROMEGA RQ1 RNase-Free DNase according to the manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality integrity was analyzed by electrophoresis gel and was validated on a Bioanalyzer 2100 (Aligent, Santa Clara, CA); RNA Integrity Number (RIN) values were greater than 7 for all the samples. In order to confirm that in stk mutant samples STK was not expressed, STK expression was checked by real time PCR with primer RT 780 (5’-TGCGATGCAGAAGTTGCGCTC-3’) and RT 781 (5’-AGTACGCGGCATTGATTTCTTG-3’). Sequencing libraries were prepared according to the manufacturer’s instructions by TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina Inc.) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 in one lane single-read 50bp. The processing of fluorescent images into sequences, base-calling and quality value calculations were performed using the Illumina data processing pipeline (version 1.8). Raw reads were filtered to obtain high-quality reads by removing low-quality reads containing more than 30% bases with Q < 20. Finally, a quality control of the raw sequence data was performed using FastQC [http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/projects/fastqc/].
Results: A total of 102,278,242 reads passed a quality filter and 85% were mapped back to the Arabidopsis TAIR10 genome. Approximately 90% mapped uniquely to only one location and could be assigned to a single annotated TAIR10 gene. Normalization of expression values was performed using RPKM values. All other parameters were kept at default levels. The CLC Genomic Workbench was also further used to determine all differentially expressed transcripts found in each cDNA library. Baggerley's test and a FDR correction were used for statistical analysis of samples. Our analysis revealed that 156 genes were upregulated, whereas for 90 genes a reduction in their mRNA level was observed in the stk mutant when compared to wild-type . Data analysis revealed a significant enrichment for terms related to the phenylpropanoid metabolic process, flavonoid biosynthetic process as well as cellular amino acid derivative metabolic process.
Conclusion: Our genome-wide transcriptomic analysis suggests that the ovule identity factor STK is involved in the regulation of several metabolic processes providing a strong connection between cell fate determination, development and metabolism. In particular we characterize, through phenotypic, genetic, biochemical and transcriptomic approaches, the role of STK in PAs biosynthesis. Our results indicate that STK exerts this role through the direct regulation of the gene encoding for BANYULS/ANTHOCYANIDIN REDUCTASE (BAN/ANR), which converts anthocyanidins into their corresponding 2,3-cis-flavan-3-ols. Our study also demonstrates that the levels of H3K9ac chromatin modification directly correlate with the active state of BAN in an STK-dependent way. This supports the theory that MADS-domain proteins control the expression of their target genes through the modification of the chromatin states. STK might recruit or negatively regulate histone modifying factors to control their activity. Moreover, we show that STK controls through a complex regulatory network not only directly BAN but also other regulators of this key gene in tannin production
Overall design: mRNA profiles  from both Arabidopsis wild-type and stk mutant inflorescences and siliques until 5 DAP were generated by deep sequencing, in duplicate according to the manufacturer’s instructions by TruSeq RNA Sample Prep kit (Illumina Inc.) and sequenced on Illumina HiSeq2000 in one lane single-read 50bp.

PRJNA255919	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Genome-wide Identification of APETALA1 Regulated Genes during Early Flower Development in Arabidopsis	"Plant inﬂorescence-to-ﬂoral phase transition is an important developmental stage, in which ﬂoral cell identities and many traits of reproductive organs are determined. Two MADS-domain transcription factors, APETALA1 (AP1) and CAULIFLOWER (CAL), have been known as master regulators controlling the early stage of the phase transition in Arabidopsis. In plants with loss-of-function alleles of ap1 and cal double mutations, flower development is heavily delayed at the ﬂower initiation stage and accumulate a large number of inﬂorescence-like meristem cells compared to wild-type plants, resulting in a cauliﬂower-like phenotype. To facilitate investigation on molecular mechanisms during inﬂorescence-to-ﬂoral phase transition, an inducible system of synchronized ﬂoral development has been developed, in which ap1,cal inﬂorescence-like meristem cells express a fusion protein of AP1 and the hormone-binding domain of the rat glucocorticoid receptor (GR) driven by 35S constitutive promoter.  When inflorescences of 35S:AP1-GR ap1,cal plants are treated by steroid hormone dexamethasone as the activator to allow the AP1-GR fusion protein translocate into nucleus, inﬂorescence-to-ﬂoral phase transition is triggered and plants start to produce hundreds of relatively synchronized ﬂoral buds.  To explore molecular basis at early stage of flower development in Arabidopsis, we used the inducible system of synchronized ﬂoral development (35S:AP1-GR ap1,cal) to profile transcriptome change of meristem cells during inﬂorescence-to-ﬂoral phase transition by strand-specific RNA-sequencing.
Overall design: Inflorescences of 35S:AP1-GR ap1,cal plants were treated with dexamethasone (Dex) for 2 hours as the actviator for induction of ﬂoral development as well as cycloheximide (Cyc) for 2 hours as mock treatment for inhibition of translation elongation. RNA libraries derived from non-treatment, 2-hour mock (Cyc) treatment and 2-hour inducer (Dex + Cyc) treatment samples with 3 biological replicates were sequenced by Illumina HiSeq 2500 with strand-specific RNA-sequencing protocol.

In addition, heterosis for bacterial defense was significantly compromised in hybrids of pad4 mutants in which the SA biosynthesis pathway was blocked. Moreover, we further revealed that increased histone H3 acetylation of the key genes involved in the SA biosynthesis pathway correlated with their up-regulated expression in hybrids.

Single-cell RNA-seq provides a wealth of information regarding the developmental state of individual cells. However, better methods are needed to map the identity of single cells, especially during identity transitions. We have developed a quantitative classification method that is robust to expression noise and can detect primary and chimeric identities from single-cell RNA sequencing profiles. The method uses existing transcriptome repositories of grouped cell-types to define a set of optimal cell-identity markers, which are then used to define a cell identity metric. This metric accurately classified diverse cell identities in Arabidopsis root tips and human glioblastoma cells. We demonstrate the strength of the approach to resolve a dynamic developmental process by analyzing the identity of single cells captured from regenerating Arabidopsis roots following removal of their stem-cell-niche. We discover that, apart from new niche formation at the vicinity of the cut site, cells that are distant from the injury site also undergo a transient, partial collapse of identity during the regeneration and reorganization of the root, demonstrating the usefulness of a quantitative cell identity metric.

Here, we generated genome-wide integrated maps of H3K27me3 modification and transcriptome for Col, C24 and their F1 hybrid, and their clf mutants. We found that H3K27me3 modification profiles were divergent between Col and C24, and were inherited mainly additively in hybrid. By comparing H3K27me3 modification ratio between parents to allelic H3K27me3 modification ratio in hybrid, we identified cis- and trans-regulatory divergence for H3K27me3 modification variation between Col and C24, and found that cis-regulatory divergence was the predominant contributor to H3K27me3 variation. The majority of genes with both cis- and trans-regulatory divergence displayed ""cis-trans"" interaction, whereas ""cis+trans"" interaction resulted in higher magnitude of H3K27me3 variation. H3K27me3 modification variation was negatively correlated with gene expression variation between Col and C24, both of which might rise from the same cis-regulatory divergence.  Moreover, cis-regulatory divergence could lead to the concurrent allelic H3K27me3 modification bias and allelic gene expression bias for auxin metabolic genes and stimulus responsive genes in Col×C24 hybrid. Natural variation of H3K27me3 modification and gene expression were changed upon CLF mutation, and heterosis, especially best-parent hetereosis, was largely compromised in clf hybrid.

PRJNA265183	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)The SNF2 and RING domain proteins FRG1 and 2 are required for RNA-directed DNA methylation in Arabidopsis [mRNA-Seq]	"DNA methylation in Arabidopsis thaliana is maintained by at least four different enzymes: MET1, CMT3, DRM2, and CMT2. However, DNA methylation is established exclusively by the enzyme DRM2, which acts in the RNA-directed DNA methylation (RdDM) pathway. Some RdDM components belong to gene families and have partially redundant functions, such as DICER-LIKE 2, 3 and 4, and IDN2- LIKE 1 and 2. Traditional mutagenesis screens usually fail to detect genes if they are redundant, since the loss of one gene can be compensated by a related gene. In an effort to circumvent this issue, we utilized co-expression data to identify closely related genes that are co-regulated with genes in the RdDM pathway. Here we report the discovery of two redundant proteins, SNF2-RING-HELICASE-LIKE1 and 2 (FRG1 and 2) that are putative chromatin-related paralogous proteins. Analysis of genome–wide bisulfite sequencing shows that simultaneous mutations of FRG1 and 2 cause broad defects in methylation at RdDM targeted loci. We also show that FRG1 stably associates with Su(var)3-9-related SUVR2, a known RdDM component, in vivo. Combined, our results identify FRG1 and FRG2 as novel components of the RdDM machinery.

Based on yeast two-hybrid and affinity purification-mass spec analysis, we suggest that AtRTF2 may act in ubiquitin-based regulation of pre-mRNA splicing and membrane signaling to the spliceosome.

PRJNA267558	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Transcriptional response to zebularine and mitomycin C (MMC) in wild type and ATR deficient Arabidopsis thaliana plants	"Zebularine is a non-methylable cytidine analog that is used in epigenetic and cancer research. Its application has been shown to activate several transcriptionally silenced genetic elements; however, extent of this activation and other effects on the transcriptome are unknown. Here, we show that zebularine treatment induces preferentially genes associated with DNA damage repair response and this activation is strongly ATR-dependent. The set of up- and down-regulated genes after 24 h zebularine treatment is almost fully contained in the set of genes with changed transcription in response to 24 h MMC treatment. We identified only few genes that were up-regulated in common by longer (5 days) zebularine treatment and loss of epigenetic control in ddm1 mutant. Our results suggest that zebularine does not induce global activation of targets of transcriptional gene silencing and indicate previously unanticipated DNA damaging effects associated with zebularine-treatment.

Genome-wide TF DNA-binding studies revealed that these TFs have several thousands of binding sites in the Arabidopsis genome, and may regulate the expression of many genes directly. Given the importance of natural variation in plant developmental programs, there is a need to understand the molecular basis of this variation at the level of developmental gene regulation. However, until now, the evolutionary turnover and dynamics of TF binding sites among plant species has not yet experimentally determined.

PRJNA269041	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Integration of Developmental and Environmental Signals via a Polyadenylation Factor in Arabidopsis	The integration of environmental and developmental signals with physiological responses is critical for plant survival. One level of integration involves posttranscriptional controls, such as RNA processing. Previously, it was found that the 30 kD subunit of Arabidopsis cleavage and polyadenylation specificity factor (AtCPSF30) is a calmodulin-regulated RNA-binding protein. In this study, genome-wide poly(A) site choice in wild-type plants, a mutant (oxt6) deficient in CPSF30 expression, a line in which CPSF30 (C30G) is expressed in the oxt6 background, and a line in which a calmodulin-binding mutant of CPSF30 (C30GM) is expressed in the oxt6 background, was determined. In addition, a number of oxt6-associated phenotypes were evaluated in the complemented lines. The phenotypic analyses show that the interaction of CPSF30 with calmodulin is important some, but not all, of the functions of the protein in the plant. The global poly(A) site analysis show that the C30G and C30GM proteins can restore wild-type poly(A) site choice to the oxt6 mutant. These results suggest that CPSF30 is a regulatory hub where different signaling cues are transduced into specified phenotypic outcomes. Less...

The patterns of altered gene expression in the hybrids point to a reduction in basal defense levels that could reflect the antagonism between plant immunity and plant growth.  Associated with this theme are changes to the salicylic acid and auxin regulated networks which are known to control abiotic and biotic defense responses as well as being important regulators of plant growth.  Increased auxin response correlates with the heterotic phenotype of greater leaf cell numbers, whereas reduced salicylic acid levels and response promotes increased leaf cell size in hybrids involving C24.  By manipulating salicylic acid levels in each of our hybrid systems, we can alter levels of heterosis, promote additional growth in the hybrids, and generate increased growth in the parents, especially C24.
Overall design: Aerial tissues of 15 days after sowing seedlings from C24, Ler, Col and their reciprocal hybrid offspring.  In total 7 biological replicates for both the C24 and Ler parents, 2 biological replicates for Col, 10 biological replicates for C24/Ler and 4 biological replicates for both C24/Col and Col/Ler were sequenced and analysed.

PRJNA271131	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Physiological and transcriptome responses to elevated CO2 and magnesium in Arabidopsis thaliana	"Background: The unprecedented rise in atmospheric CO2 concentration and injudicious fertilization or heterogeneous distribution of Mg in the soil warrant further research to understand the synergistic and holistic mechanisms involved in the plant growth regulation. The objective of this work is to understand responses in plants along with interactive effect of elevated CO2 and Mg levels by comparing data on single stress with that of combined stresses.
Results: This study investigated the influence of elevated CO2 (800 μL L−1) on physiological and transcriptomic profiles in Arabidopsis cultured in hydroponic media treated with 1 μM (low), 1000 μM (normal) and 10000 μM (high) Mg2+. Following 7-d treatment, elevated CO2 increased the shoot growth and chlorophyll content under both low and normal Mg supply, whereas root growth was improved exclusively under normal Mg nutrition. Notably, the effect of elevated CO2 on mineral homeostasis in both shoots and roots was less than that of Mg supply. Irrespective of CO2 treatment, high Mg increased leaf number but decreased root growth and absorption of P, K, Ca, Fe and Mn whereas low Mg increased the concentration of P, K, Ca and Fe in leaves. Elevated CO2 decreased the expression of genes related to cadmium response, cell redox homeostasis and lipid localization, but enhanced photosynthesis, signal transduction, protein phosphorylation, NBS-LRR disease resistance proteins and subsequently programmed cell death in low-Mg shoots. By comparison, elevated CO2 enhanced the response of lipid localization (mainly LTP transfer protein/protease inhibitor), endomembrane system, heme binding and cell wall modification in high-Mg roots. Some of these transcriptomic results are substantially in accordance with our physiological and/or biochemical analysis.
Conclusions: Contrasting changes were found between roots and shoots with the shoot transcriptome being more severely affected by low Mg while the root transcriptome more affected by high Mg. Elevated CO2 had a greater effect on transcript response in low Mg-fed shoots as well as in high Mg-fed roots. The present findings broaden our current understanding on the interactive effect of elevated CO2 and Mg levels in the Arabidopsis, which may help to design the novel metabolic engineering strategies to cope with Mg deficiency/excess in crops under elevated CO2.

PRJNA271284	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)A mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and evolution of C4 photosynthesis	"Physiological and molecular evidences have shown earlier that low CO2 might have been a major driving force during the evolution of C4 photosynthesis, not only being a selection pressure but also as a signaling agent. However, a mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and C4 emergence is missing. In this study, using transcriptomics study in model plant Arabidopsis thaliana, we demonstrated that under long-term low CO2 treatments, the up-regulation of C4 related genes were linked to the up-regulation of genes involved in photorespiration, nitrogen assimilation and glycolysis. Plants under low CO2 also showed altered d13C. The carbonic anhydrase (CA), phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase (PEPC), malate dehydrogenase (MDH), glutamine oxoglutarate aminotransferase (GS-GOGAT), which are required to reassimilate ammonia, were up-regulated under low CO2. Furthermore, under low CO2, genes involved in PEP regeneration from glycolysis were up-regulated while pyruvate orthophosphate dikinase (PPDK) was down-regulated, suggesting a route of PEP regeneration from glycolysis. All these results suggested that under long-term low CO2 treatment, the selection pressure to recapture the released ammonia from the increased photorespiration might have promoted the evolution of mechanisms for generation PEP from glycolysis and enhancement of enzymes catalyzing formation of oxaloacetate, one intermediate which can accept ammonia residue. These adjustments in metabolism provide a mechanistic linkage between low CO2 and evolution of C4 photosynthesis.

PRJNA271395	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)SUVH1, a histone methyltransferase, is required for the expression of genes targeted by DNA methylation	"Transposons and repeats are found throughout the genomes of all organisms. To prevent the harmful effects of these elements, repressive marks such as DNA methylation and H3K9me2 have evolved to control transposon activity and ultimately maintain genome integrity. However, how silencing mechanisms are themselves regulated to avoid stochastic silencing of genes remains unclear. Here, negative regulators of silencing were identified using a forward-genetic screen on a reporter line that harbors a LUCIFERASE (LUC) gene driven by a double 35S promoter. SUVH1, a SU(VAR)3-9 homolog, was isolated as a factor promoting the expression of the LUC gene. Treatment with a cytosine methylation inhibitor compromised the effect of the identified suvh1 mutation, indicating that SUVH1 is dispensable for LUC expression in the absence of DNA methylation. However, the suvh1 mutation did not alter DNA methylation levels at the LUC region or on a genome-wide scale; thus, SUVH1 may function downstream of DNA methylation. Histone methylation analysis revealed that suvh1 led to decreased H3K4me3 levels; in contrast, H3K9me2 levels remained unchanged. Moreover, the characterization of endogenous genes indicated that SUVH1 functions at genes with repressive marks in the promoter region. Taken together, these findings shed light on the regulatory network acting at genes with various epigenetic marks.
Overall design: The BS-seq and mRNA-seq were performed on the reporter line YJ and the mutant YJ suvh1 to assess the effect on DNA methylation and transcriptome caused by suvh1 mutation Less..."

PRJNA271499	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Translatome analyses of opposing tissue-specific brassinosteroid signals orchestrating root meristem differentiation	"The mechanisms ensuring balanced growth remain a critical question in developmental biology. In plants, this balance relies on spatiotemporal integration of hormonal signaling pathways, but the understanding of the precise contribution of each hormone is just beginning to take form. Brassinosteroid (BR) hormone, is shown here to have opposing effects on root meristem size, depending on its site of action. BR is demonstrated to both delay and promote onset of stem cell daughter differentiation, when acting in the outer tissue of the root meristem, the epidermis, and the inner-most tissue, the stele, respectively. To understand the molecular basis of this phenomenon, a comprehensive spatiotemporal translatome mapping of Arabidopsis roots was performed. Analyses of wild type and mutants featuring different distributions of BR, revealed autonomous, tissue-specific gene responses to BR, implying its contrasting tissue-dependent impact on growth. BR-induced genes were primarily detected in epidermal cells of the basal meristem zone and were enriched by auxin-related genes. In contrast, repressed BR genes prevailed in the stele of the apical meristem zone. Furthermore, auxin was found to mediate the growth-promoting impact of BR signaling originating in the epidermis, while BR signaling in the stele buffered this effect. We propose that context-specific BR activity and responses are oppositely interpreted at the organ level, ensuring coherent growth.
Overall design: 24 samples of polyribosome-associated mRNA (following 0, 3, and 8 hours of BR treatment, in two biological repetitions), were collected. RNA samples were sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, to obtain 50 bp single-end reads. These reads were aligned to the TAIR10 assembly of the Arabidopsis thaliana genome, using Tophat2 v2.0.9. Transcript coordinates from the TAIR10 reference set were used to guide the alignment process. After alignment, the numbers of reads per transcript were estimated using HTSeq v0.5.3p3, and DESeq2 v1.2.8 was used to normalize read counts and call differentially expressed genes. Less..."

PRJNA275436	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Hybrid Mimics and Hybrid Vigor in Arabidopsis (F6 data)	"F1 hybrids can outperform their parents in yield and vegetative biomass, features of hybrid vigor which form the basis of the hybrid seed industry.  The yield advantage of the F1 is lost in the F2 and subsequent generations.  In Arabidopsis, from F2 plants which have a F1 –like phenotype, we have by recurrent selection produced pure breeding F5/F6 lines “Hybrid Mimics”, in which the characteristics of the F1 Hybrid are stabilized.  These Hybrid Mimic lines, like the F1 Hybrid, have larger leaves than the parent plant, the leaves having increased photosynthetic cell numbers, and in some lines increased size of cells, suggesting an increased supply of photosynthate.  A comparison of the differentially expressed genes in the F1 Hybrid with those of eight Hybrid Mimic lines has identified metabolic pathways altered in both; these pathways include down regulation of defense response pathways and altered abiotic response pathways.  F6 Hybrid Mimic lines are mostly homozygous at each locus in the genome yet retain the large F1-like phenotype.  Many alleles in the F6 plants, when they are homozygous, have expression levels different to the level in the parent.  We consider this altered expression to be a consequence of trans-regulation of genes from one parent by genes from the other parent.  Transregulation could also arise from epigenetic modifications in the F1.  The pure breeding Hybrid Mimics have been valuable in probing the mechanisms of hybrid vigor and may also prove to be useful hybrid vigor equivalents in agriculture.
Overall design: Plant Materials: Seeds were sterilized and sown onto plates containing MSN medium (MS salts supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose, pH7 with KOH, 0.6% wt/vol Noble agar).  After 2 days at 4°C, the plates were transferred to a growth room with conditions of 22 °C/18 °C (day/night) and 16h light/8h dark cycle under Philips Cool Daylight TLD 58W/840 fluorescent tubes providing a photosynthetic photon flux density of 130 - 150μmol photons m-2·s-1 as measured using a quantum meter (Model MQ-200 calibrated for electric light source, Apogee).  At 18 days after sowing (DAS), the plants were transferred to soil and grown to the reproductive stage in a growth room with controlled light conditions (OSRAM L 36W/865 LumLux Daylight, 130 - 150μmol photons m-2·s-1).  To minimize the edge effects, the positioning of both plates and trays on the shelves was rotated every two days.  All the plants were grown under the condition described above unless specified.
Plant sample preparation and RNA extraction:  For the transcriptomes of 15 DAS plants, the aerial tissues of 15 day seedlings were sampled.  For the transcriptomes of plants at 28 DAS, the four largest leaves of 28 day plants from the parental lines (C24, Ler), the reciprocal Hybrids and eight F4 Hybrid Mimic lines were harvested.  Each sample comprised a pool of five plants.  Two biological replicates of each sample were sequenced.  Total RNA was isolated using QIAGEN RNeasy MiniKitTM following the product instructions.  To eliminate variation in experimental conditions in different positions in the growth room, nine F4 plant lines were divided into two batches to ensure plants were grown on the same shelves in each experiment.   Parental lines C24 and Ler and the F1 Hybrid from which the F4 lines derived from were grown under the same conditions in each experiment as controls.  The first batch including samples C24 (RepA and RepB), Ler (RepA and RepB), C24 x Ler F1, F4-L1-1, F4-L1-2, F4-L2-1, F4-L2-2 and F4-S-1 were grown under the condition describe above, we also sampled the five smallest C24 seedlings and five smallest Ler seedlings among the population (n = 50); the mRNA sequencing was performed by the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF).  The second batch including C24 (RepC and RepD), Ler (RepC and RepD), Ler x C24 F1 Hybrid, F4-L3-1, F4-L3-2, F4-L4-1 and F4-L4-2 were grown in the same light intensity as above but under different light tubes (SYLVANIA PREMIUM extra FL36W/865 Super Daylight deluxe light tube).
For the transcriptome of the two F6 Hybrid Mimic lines at 15 DAS, C24, Ler, Ler x C24 F1 Hybrids and three siblings from each F6 line (L3-1-1-2 and L4-2-1-2) were grown on MS medium (MS salts supplemented with 1% (w/v) sucrose, pH 5.7 with KOH, add 0.6% wt/vol agar) with controlled light conditions (SYLVANIA PREMIUM extra FL36W/865 Super Daylight deluxe, 130 - 150μmol photons m-2·s-1).

PRJNA274887	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Transcriptome analysis of apoplastic reactive oxygen species signaling and dissection of its regulatory pathways	"As sessile organism, plants evolved a highly complicated signaling system to cope with unfavorable and fluctuating environmental conditions. Rapid and transient Reactive Oxygen Species (ROS) burst is a common response to both biotic and abiotic stresses. Plants exposed with O3 could trigger extracellular similar ROS production through cell wall peroxidases and NPADPH oxidases, resulting in changes in the gene expression and cell death. Whereas ROS induced cell death is not simply due to its toxicity, rather due to interplay with several other signaling pathways, such as salicylic acid (SA), jasmonic acid (JA) and ethylene signaling pathways. Furthermore, the three hormones have both synergistic and antagonistic interactions, where the suppression of JA signaling by SA is the mostly studied. In addition, ethylene promotes cell death while JA has a protective role upon O3 exposure. The role of SA is more complicated; depending on the genetic background it can have either cell death promoting or protecting roles. Hence, a clean system to deliver apoplastic ROS is required to study the role of ROS apart from con-current activation of other signaling pathways. Arabidopsis thaliana offer a convenient system to study apoplastic ROS signaling due to the availability of hormone signaling or biosynthesis mutants including the JA receptor mutant coi1-16 (CORONATINE INSENSITIVE1), the essential ethylene signaling mutant ein2 (ETHYLENE INSENSITIVE2), the SA biosynthesis mutant sid2 (SALICYLIC ACID INDUCTION DEFICIENT2 also known as ISOCHORISMATE SYNTHASE1), and essential regulators in SA/JA/ethylene-induced defense response triple mutant tga2 tga5 tga6 (Clade II TGA transcription factors). Here we used a combination of transcriptome analysis, cell death assays and mutant analysis to systematically quantified the contribution of hormone signaling in relation to apoplastic ROS signaling, identified transcription factors (TFs) involved in ROS regulation and dissected the components involved in defense hormones associated cell death.

PRJNA276134	Chemical modifications mark alternatively spliced and actively degrading messenger RNAs in Arabidopsis and humans	"Post-transcriptional chemical modification of RNA bases is a widespread and physiologically relevant regulator of RNA maturation, stability, and function. While modifications are best characterized in short, noncoding RNAs such as transfer RNAs (tRNAs), growing evidence indicates that messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs) are likewise modified. Here, we apply our High-throughput Annotation of Modified Ribonucleotides (HAMR) pipeline to identify and classify modifications that affect Watson-Crick base-pairing at three different levels of the human and Arabidopsis thaliana transcriptomes (polyadenylated, small, and degrading RNAs). We find modifications primarily within actively degrading mRNAs and lncRNAs, suggesting they can act as a potent signal for RNA turnover. Additionally, modifications within stable mRNAs mark alternatively spliced introns, suggesting they regulate splicing. Furthermore, these modifications target mRNAs with coherent functions, including stress responses. Thus, our comprehensive analysis of RNA modification across multiple RNA classes yields new functional insights into these covalent RNA additions.

PRJNA276789	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Root specific silencing-related and nitrogen-dependent small RNA profiling of Arabidopsis transgenic plants	Small RNAs including microRNAs (miRNAs) and small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are important regulators of gene expression, in response to environmental stresses and silencing of risky dysfunctional or invading RNAs. The constitutive expression of ammonium transporter (AMT) AtAMT1;1 under a atamt1;1-1 (ko11) mutant background of Arabidopsis thaliana showed higher transcript level in shoots under nitrogen starvation and degradation in roots. Whether the nitrogen- and organ- dependent expression of AtAMT1;1 is regulated by small RNAs remains unknown. To identify potential silencing-related small RNAs, we first compared small RNA profiles between a stable ProAtUBQ10:AtAMT1;1 transgene and the silencing 35S:AtAMT1;1 transgene in ko11 background roots. High throughput sequencing of small RNAs from the roots of 6-week-old hydroponic plants of the two transgenic lines under normal nitrogen supply identified multiple secondary AtAMT1;1 gene-specific siRNAs, which were expressed at high levels in the degraded line. To further investigate the potential nitrogen-dependent small RNAs, we sequenced the library constructed from roots of 6-week-old hydroponic ProAtUBQ10:AtAMT1;1 transgenic plants treated with 4-day nitrogen-depletion before harvest. In contrast, we found no evidence for involvement of endogenous small RNAs. Taken together, our findings provide evidence for important roles of small RNAs in post-transcriptional regulation of AtAMT1;1 transcript stability in roots. Less...

H3K9ac and H3K4me3 marks were highly convergent at all stages of leaf aging, but H3K4me3 marks covered nearly twice the gene area as H3K9ac marks. Genes with the greatest fold-change in expression displayed the largest positively-correlated percent change in coverage for both marks. Most senescence up-regulated genes were pre-marked by H3K4me3 and H3K9ac, but at levels below the whole-genome average, and for these genes, gene expression increased without a significant increase in either histone mark. However, for a subset of genes showing increased or decreased expression, the respective gain or loss of H3K4me3 marks were found to closely match the temporal changes in mRNA abundance. 22% of genes that increased expression during senescence showed accompanying changes in H3K4me3 modification, and they include numerous regulatory genes, which may act as primary response genes.

PRJNA283608	Arabidopsis thalianaDifferential mRNA accumulation upon early Arabidopsis thaliana infection with ORMV and TMV-Cg is associated with distinct endogenous sRNAs levels	Small RNAs (sRNAs) play important roles in plant development and host-pathogen interactions. Several studies have highlighted the relationship between viral infections, endogenous sRNA accumulation and transcriptional changes associated with symptoms. However, few studies have described a global analysis of endogenous sRNAs by comparing related viruses at early stages of infection, especially before viral accumulation reaches systemic tissues.An sRNA deep-sequencing of Arabidopsis thaliana leaf samples infected either with Oilseed rape mosaic virus (ORMV) or crucifer-infecting Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV-Cg) with slightly different symptomatology at two early stages of infection (2 and 4dpi) was performed. At early stages, both viral infections strongly alter the patterns of several types of endogenous sRNA species in distal tissues with no virus suggesting a systemic signaling process foregoing virus accumulation. We then focused on differential levels of endogenous sRNAs derived from protein coding genes and explored their potential role in expression control. A correlation between many of these sRNAs and the associated mRNA transcripts was detected, suggesting that an unknown recursive mechanism might be involved in a regulatory circuit encompassing this sRNA/mRNA equilibrium. This work represents the initial step in uncovering how differential accumulation of endogenous sRNAs may contribute to explain the massive alteration of the transcriptome associated to plant-virus interactions.

PRJNA213845	Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)Arabidopsis thaliana Transcriptome or Gene expression	We investigated the relationship between transposable elements (TEs), small RNA and gene expression in hybrids by sequencing small RNA and mRNA in parents and hybrid offspring. Both the presence of TEs in a gene, and the expression of small RNA with sequence matching a gene, were associated with higher probability of non-additive mRNA inheritance patterns in hybrids. Genes with TEs present within the gene boundaries were mainly associated with low-parent inheritance, and many of these genes also expressed both sense and antisense strand small RNA. In addition to the expected patterns of repression of mRNA expression by small RNA, we also found that highly expressed and high-parent inherited mRNAs are also associated with small RNA. In these cases, the small RNA was expressed predominantly or exclusively from the sense strand. Highly expressed genes showing high-parent inheritance in hybrids were also less likely to harbor TEs, especially retrotransposons. Furthermore, the two distinct classes of small RNA were correlated with different chromatin marks. While small RNA consisting of a mixed population of sense and antisense, consistent with siRNA, was associated with repressive C methylation, small RNA expressed exclusively or predominantly from the sense strand was associated with regions of CG methylation, known to be an activating mark. Thus, activation as well as repression of gene expression in hybrids can be associated with gene-derived small RNA, with strandedness of the small RNA, presence of TEs and C versus CG methylation distinguishing the two patterns.

"Arabidopsis thaliana polyamine oxidase 5 gene (AtPAO5) functions as a thermospermine (T-Spm) oxidase. Aerial growth of its knock-out mutant (Atpao5-2) is significantly repressed by low dose(s) of T-Spm but not by other polyamines. Massive analysis of 3’-cDNA ends (MACE) was performed. Cell wall, lipid and secondary metabolisms were dramatically affected in low dose T-Spm-treated Atpao5-2. Intriguingly Fe-deficient responsive genes and drought stress-induced genes were up-regulated, suggesting that vascular system loses the function. Histological observation showed that vascular system of the joint part between stem and leaves was structurally destroyed. The results indicate that T-Spm homeostasis by a balance of synthesis and catabolism, catalysed by AtPAO5 in Arabidopsis, is important for maintaining vascular system. Phylogenetic analysis showed that PAOs from vascular plants are classified into four clades (I-IV) and AtPAO5 belongs to the clade III. Clade III members show high identity to metazoan PAOs and are not found in non-vascular plants. Furthermore, all the clade III genes are intron-less or contain a single intron whereas the other three clade genes usually contain 7 to 9 introns. The data suggest the occurrence of a horizontal gene transfer of ancestral clade III PAO gene(s) from primitive animals. Fine tuning of T-Spm metabolism is critical for vascular plants and its catabolic gene was acquired from a certain Metazoan to equip the vascular system.

PRJNA479770	H2A.W is essential for silencing of whole genome heterochromatin in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Heterochromatin of flowering plants is occupied by histone variant H2A.W and marked by DNA and H3K9 methylation. The relative impact of these heterochromatic features on activity of Transposable Elements (TEs) remains largely unknown. We obtained mutants deficient for H2A.W and key components controlling each of the key heterochromatic pathway in Arabidopsis and observed that knock out of individual pathway does not affect in a major manner TEs activity. However, when we combine the loss of H2A.W with any of the other heterochromatin controller we observe synergistic effects on heterochromatin compaction as well TEs activity. H2A.W appears to control expression of all TEs while each other heterochromatin controller target distinct subsets of TEs. We also observe an impact of linker histone H1. We propose that H2A.W acts together with several components of heterochromatin to prevents activity of distinct sets of TEs activity and chromatin architecture. Synergistic action with H2A.W is more prominent specifically in pathways controlled by the plant specific DNA chromomethyltransferases, CMT2 and CMT3.

PRJNA600493	Active DNA demethylation regulates myo-inositol-mediated mutualism between plants and beneficial rhizobacteria [TAIR-RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Plants develop mutualistic association with beneficial rhizobacteria. To understand this important phenomenon, early mechanisms for establishing the mutualism are critical. Here we report that active DNA demethylation in plants controls root secretion of myo-inositol, which triggers and further facilitates colonization of the beneficial rhizobacteria Bacillus megaterium strain YC4, thereby allowing for plant growth-promotion. YC4 promotes plant growth but the beneficial effects were lost in the Arabidopsis mutant rdd that is defective in active DNA demethylation. Roots of rdd failed to associate with YC4, meanwhile the level of myo-inositol in root exudates was drastically reduced in rdd. Supplementation of myo-inositol to rdd restored YC4 colonization and plant growth-promotion, while plants with defective myo-inositol monophosphatase also failed in establishing mutualism with YC4. myo-Inositol not only induced chemotaxis of YC4 but also increased YC4 biofilm production, consistent with the transcriptional regulation of YC4 by myo-inositol. In addition, myo-inositol preferentially attracts Bacillus megaterium among the examined bacteria species. Regardless of YC4 inoculation, myo-inositol biosynthesis and catabolism genes are down- and up-regulated, respectively, in rdd compared to wild type plants. The differential expression of myo-inositol homeostasis genes is correlated with local DNA hypermethylation, whereas genetic disruption of the RNA-directed DNA methylation pathway abolished these epigenetic marks and reset the corresponding gene expression patterns, resulting in restored YC4 colonization and plant growth-promotion. Importantly, that active DNA demethylation controls myo-inositol-mediated mutualism between YC4 and plants was also demonstrated in Solanum lycopersicum. Our results uncover an important function of myo-inositol in plant-microbe interactions and its dependence on plant epigenetic regulation.

PRJNA605012	SKIP regulates ABA-mediated alternative splicing and its signaling in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Abscisic acid (ABA) plays a key role in plant development and responses to abiotic stress. A wide number of regulatory mechanisms on ABA perception and signaling are known, including transcriptional regulation and post-translational regulations; however, less to know about the post-transcriptional regulations. In this work, we have found that SKIP, a splicing factor in spliceosome, positively regulates ABA signal transduction. Mutation of SKIP, skip-1, confers ABA insensitive phenotype in seed germination, root growth, and ABA-responsive gene expression. Transformation of SKIP genomic DNA to skip-1 is able to recover its defects. SKIP binds to the pre-mRNA of genes in ABA signaling, such as PYL8, to regulate their splicing. The alternative splicing of PYL7, PYL8, ABF2, and ABI5 in ABA pathway is disrupted by skip-1, reducing the mRNA levels of them. The abnormal splicing of PP2Cs activates their transcription by skip-1, suggesting there is a feedback regulation for PP2Cs caused by skip-1. The down-regulation of PYL ABA receptors, ABF2 and ABI5 ABA response transcription factors, and the up-regulation of PP2Cs through alternative splicing reduce the plant responses to ABA in skip-1. SKIP is required for ABA-mediated genome-wide alternative splicing. ABA treatment enhances the novel splicing events in WT genome-widely. The novel alternative splicing events are increased by skip-1 in the absence and present of ABA. Our results first reveal a principle on how a splicing factor affects the ABA signaling.

Methods: After 3-day imbibition, sweet1 seeds were sown on ½ MS medium and grown under constant light, 22 °C for 24 hours. Seeds were transferred to ½ MS liquid medium supplemented with either 60 mM Glc, 5 µM ABA or both for 6 hours. Four biological replicates were collected for each treatment. Total RNA was extracted by RNeasy PowerPlant Kit (13500-50, Qiagen), The libraries were prepared from 1 µg total RNA using KAPA mRNA Hyper Prep kit (KK8581, Roche) with KAPA Dual-indexed Adapter kit (KK8722, Roche). The libraries were sequenced by Hiseq 2500 (Illumina) with paired-end reads.
Results: Gene expression level was quantified using Kallisto v 0.44.0 by mapping to Arabidopsis thaliana (version 11) primary transcript sequences. Samples were evaluated based on pair-wise comparison between different conditions and outliers within each treatment were removed for the further analysis based on PCA results. Candidates with more than 10 counts per million reads in at least 50% samples, |b| ≥ 0.2 and q-value < 0.05 were identified as differentially expressed genes (DEGs) using Sleuth program. Hierarchical clustering of DEGs uncovered several pathways that may contribute to glucose antagonizing ABA function.
Conclusions: This study represents the detailed analysis of transcriptome in germinating seeds under ABA+Glc treatment. Our study provides a new perspective on the interaction between ABA and Glc in response to external stimuli to control the seed germination.

PRJNA766035	TONSOKU reads the histone H3.1 variant to mediate DNA repair during replication (thale cress)	"The histone H3.1 variant is specifically inserted on chromatin during DNA replication in eukaryotes. A single amino acid variation (position 31) in the N-terminal tail of H3.1 compared to replication-independent H3.3 is conserved in plants and animals, but no function has been assigned to amino acid 31 to justify a role for H3.1 during replication. In this study, we demonstrate that the protein TONSOKU (TSK/TONSL), which participates in rescuing broken replication forks, specifically interacts with H3.1 via recognition of alanine 31 by its tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain. We show that genomic amplification in the absence of H3K27me1 in plants depends on H3.1, TSK and DNA polymerase theta (Pol θ).

PRJNA774291	H3K9 demethylation-mediated transcriptional activation is required for male meiosis in Arabidopsis thaliana (thale cress)	"Dimethylation at histone H3 lysine 9 (H3K9me2), a critical mark for heterochromatin formation and transcriptional silencing, is usually methylated at transposable elements and repetitive sequences but unmethylated at bodies of protein-coding genes. It is known that deposition of H3K9me2 is essential for proper prophase progression in both mammals and plants. Nevertheless, function of removing H3K9me2 for meiosis is unknown. In this study, we show that H3K9 demethylases, IBM1 and JMJ27, together regulate chromosome pairing and segregation in early meiosis, through protecting thousands of protein-coding genes from ectopic H3K9me2, including meiotic-essential genes. In addition to IBM1 and JMJ27, we also found that the cohesin complex cofactors Precocious Dissociation of Sisters 5 (PDS5s) regulate the expression of essential meiotic genes by interacting with H3K9 demethylases, acting downstream of H3K9 demethylation. Therefore, H3K9 demethylases and PDS5s coordinately regulate male meiosis through regulating the expression of meiotic-essential genes. These findings provide insights into a novel function of removing H3K9me2 for meiosis and deeper understanding of the H3K9 demethylation-mediated transcriptional activation pathway.

PRJNA784110	Epigenetic reprogramming orchestrates transcriptional responses in shade avoidance syndrome of Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"For shade-intolerant plants, changes in light quality indicative of competition from neighboring plants trigger shade avoidance syndrome (SAS). PYHTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 7 is the major transcriptional regulator of SAS in Arabidopsis. However, the epigenetic reprogramming under shade is poorly understood. To identify the histone chaperone ASF1 and HIRA function during SAS, we performed transcriptome deep sequencing (RNA-seq) to search for differentially expressed genes (DEGs) by comparing transcript levels between Col-0 and pif7-1, asf1ab, or hira-1 seedlings during white light and shade conditions. Our data shown that histone chaperone ASF1, through interacting with PIF7 and helping of HIRA, positively regulates shade-induced genes expression.

Uninfected 30-day-old detached Arabidopsis rosette leaves of wild type Col-0, knock-out line VQ28KO12 and overexpression line VQ28OE9 were collected to isolate total RNA. Then, we created a final cDNA library and performed the 2×150bp paired-end sequencing on an Illumina Novaseq™ 6000. After removed the low quality bases and undetermined bases, we mapped reads to the genome.  The differentially expressed mRNAs were selected with fold change > 2 or fold change < 0.5 and p value < 0.05, and then analysis GO enrichment and KEGG enrichment to the differentially expressed mRNAs. In comparison with Col-0, constitutively overexpressing VQ28 caused the enrichment of most genes in MAPK signaling pathway and plant hormone signal transduction. Among the 11 genes up-regulated in VQ28OE9 but down-regulated in VQ28KO12, examining their expression by querying the Arabidopsis eFP Browser which contains an extensive collection of gene expression microarray data, six of them were involved in the response to abscisic acid (ABA). qRT-PCR analyses of expression presented that the six ABA-related genes were up-regulated in VQ28OE9 without infection.

Here we tested the use of Reverse Transcriptase inhibitors to avoid LTR-TE mobilization in plants. We demonstrated that the application of the drug Tenofovir in systems with high LTR-TE activity, like Arabidopsis and rice, allows generation of plants free from LTR-TE insertions without interfering with their development. We propose the use of Tenofovir as a new tool to both study LTR-TE transposition and to regenerate more genetically stable plant lines from tissue culture.

PRJNA821458	Conserved and plant-specific GCN5-containing complexes cooperate to regulate gene transcription and plant development [RNA-Seq] (thale cress)	"Although the conserved histone acetyltransferase HAG1/GCN5-containing complex SAGA (Spt-Ada-Gcn5 acetyltransferase) has been extensively studied in plants, whether HAG1 forms a plant-specific complex is unknown. Here, we identified a plant-specific GCN5-containing complex, PAGA (plant-ADA2A-GCN5-acetyltransferase), in Arabidopsis thaliana; the complex consists of two conserved subunits (HAG1/GCN5 and ADA2A) and four plant-specific subunits (SPC, ING1, SDRL, and EAF6). In the PAGA complex, SPC functions as a scaffold protein that is responsible for integrating the other subunits. SPC also enhances the binding of ING1 to histone H3 with methylated lysine 4 and promotes the histone acetylation activity of HAG1. Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing indicated that PAGA not only shares target genes with SAGA but also has its specific target genes. While PAGA and SAGA promote transcription by mediating moderate and high levels of histone acetylation, respectively, at different sets of genes, PAGA can also function antagonistically against SAGA to prevent excessive transcription of PAGA- and SAGA-shared target genes. Unlike SAGA, which regulates multiple biological processes, PAGA is mainly involved in plant height and branch growth by regulating the transcription of genes involved in hormone biosynthesis and response. These results indicate that the HAG1-containing SAGA and PAGA complexes are coordinated to regulate gene transcription and development.

PRJNA828457	Cell-type specific alternative splicing in the Arabidopsis germline (thale cress)	"During sexual reproduction in flowering plants, the two haploid sperm cells embedded within the cytoplasm of a growing pollen tube are carried to the embryo sac for double fertilization. Pollen development in flowering plants is a dynamic process that encompasses changes at transcriptome and epigenome level. While the transcriptome of pollen and sperm cells in Arabidopsis thaliana is well documented, previous analyses were mostly based on expression at gene level. In-depth transcriptome analysis, particularly the extent of alternative splicing at the resolution of sperm cell and vegetative nucleus was still lacking. Therefore, we performed RNA-seq analysis to generate a spliceome map of Arabidopsis sperm cells and vegetative nuclei isolated from mature pollen grains.
Based on our de-novo transcriptome assembly we identified 58039 transcripts, including 9681 novel transcripts, of which 2091were expressed in sperm cells and 3600 in vegetative nuclei. Our data from sperm cell and vegetative nucleus identified 468 genes that were regulated both at gene and splicing level, with many having functions in mRNA splicing, chromatin modification, and protein localization. Moreover, a comparison with egg cell RNA-seq data uncovered sex-specific regulation of transcription and splicing factors. Our study provides novel insights into a gamete specific alternative splicing landscape at unprecedented resolution.

PRJNA842357	The F-box cofactor UFO redirects the LEAFY floral regulator to novel cis-elements (thale cress)	"In angiosperms, flower patterning requires the localized expression of the APETALA3 (AP3) floral homeotic gene involved in petal and stamen development. AP3 is synergistically induced by the master transcription factor LEAFY (LFY) and the F-box protein UNUSUAL FLORAL ORGANS (UFO), but the molecular mechanism underlying this synergy has remained unknown. Here we show that the connection to ubiquitination pathways suggested by the F-box domain of UFO is mostly dispensable and that UFO instead acts by forming a transcriptional complex with LFY on newly discovered regulatory elements. The cryo-electron microscopy structure of the UFO-LFY-DNA complex shows that UFO-DNA contacts allows relocating LFY to novel DNA sites. Finally, we show that this complex has a deep evolutionary origin, largely predating flowering plants. This work unravels an unsuspected role for a member of one of the largest protein families in plants as a modulator of the DNA binding specificity of a master TF.
Overall design: ampDAP-seq experiments with tagged LFY, LFYK249R and UFO proteins were done on 2-weeks old Arabidopsis thaliana seedlings. LFY and UFO tagged proteins were first mixed together and then with DNA prior to affinity purification. The same strategy was applied to the mutated version of LFY (LFYK249R), with and without UFO.

PRJNA850008	Double-haploid induction induces extensive variation in DNA methylation in Arabidopsis (thale cress)	"Doubled haploids (DHs) fix traits from hybrids in one generation. DH induction includes two changes in ploidy levels typically associated with variation in DNA methylation. However, DNA methylation patterns in DH plants and their biological significance are largely unknown. We generated three DH lines in Arabidopsis thaliana by crossing a haploid inducer to the accession Col-0, thus removing tissue culture and hybridization as a variable. DH induction produced thousands of differentially DNA methylated regions (DMRs), most of which were stochastic. Both haploidization and colchicine-induced genome duplication produced DMRs; the former mainly yielded DMRs at non-CG contexts, whereas the latter affected differential gene body methylation. Spontaneous genome doubling of haploid plants also induced DMRs in greater numbers than self-propagation. Our results provide the first evidence that haploid induction and genome doubling result in differential DNA methylation, offering a novel approach to induce epialleles.

This phenotypic plasticity implies complex mechanisms regulating gene expression reprogramming in response to environmental alteration. Histone variants contribute to the chromatin dynamics and transcriptional control, yet how their deposition/eviction modulates transcriptional changes induced by environmental cues remains elusive. In Arabidopsis thaliana, temperature elevation-induced transcriptional activation at thermo-responsive genes entails the chromatin eviction of a histone variant H2A.Z by INO80, which is recruited to these loci via interacting with a key thermomorphogenesis regulator PHYTOCHROME-INTERACTING FACTOR 4 (PIF4). Here, we show that both INO80 and the deposition chaperones of another histone variant H3.3 associate with EARLY FLOWERING7 (ELF7), a critical component of the transcription elongation factor polymerase-associated factor 1 complex (PAF1c). H3.3 promotes thermomorphogenesis and the high temperature-enhanced RNA Pol II transcription at PIF4 targets, and it is broadly required for the H2A.Z removal-induced gene activation.

PRJNA860957	Promoter-pervasive transcription causes RNA polymerase II pausing to boost DOG1 expression in response to salt (thale cress)	"Eukaryotic genomes are pervasively transcribed by RNA polymerase II. Yet, the molecular and biological implications of such a phenomenon are still largely puzzling. Here, we describe noncoding RNA transcription upstream of the Arabidopsis thaliana DOG1 gene, which governs salt stress responses and is a key regulator of seed dormancy. We find that expression of the DOG1 gene is induced by salt stress, thereby causing a delay in seed germination. We uncover extensive transcriptional activity on the promoter of the DOG1 gene, which produces a variety of lncRNAs. These lncRNAs, named PUPPIES, are co-directionally transcribed and extend into the DOG1 coding region. We show that PUPPIES RNAs respond to salt stress and boost DOG1 expression, resulting in delayed germination. This positive role of pervasive PUPPIES transcription on DOG1 gene expression is associated with augmented pausing of RNA polymerase II, slower transcription and higher transcriptional burst size. These findings highlight the positive role of upstream co-directional transcription in controlling transcriptional dynamics of downstream genes.

PRJNA867717	A complex role of Arabidopsis CDKD;3 in meiotic progression and cytokinesis (thale cress)	"Meiosis is a specialized cell division that halves the number of chromosomes in two consecutive rounds of chromosome segregation. In angiosperm plants is meiosis followed by mitotic divisions to form rudimentary haploid gametophytes. In Arabidopsis, termination of meiosis and transition to gametophytic development is governed by TDM1 and SMG7 that mediate inhibition of translation. Mutants deficient in this mechanism do not form tetrads, but instead undergo multiple cycles of aberrant nuclear divisions, that are likely caused by the failure to downregulate cyclin dependent kinases during meiotic exit. A suppressor screen to identify genes that contribute to meiotic exit uncovered a mutation in CDKD;3 that alleviates meiotic defects in smg7 deficient plants. The CDKD;3 deficiency prevents aberrant meiotic divisions observed in smg7 mutants, or delays their onset after initiation of cytokinesis, which permits formation of functional microspores. Although CDKD;3 acts as an activator of CDKA;1, the main cyclin dependent kinase that regulates meiosis, cdkd;3 mutation appears to promote meiotic exit independently of CDKA;1. Furthermore, analysis of CDKD;3 interactome revealed enrichment for proteins implicated in cytokinesis suggesting a more complex function of CDKD;3 in cell cycle regulation.

Here we performed a gain-of-function screen for proteins that could silence a target gene when fused to an artificial zinc finger. We uncovered many proteins that suppressed gene expression through DNA methylation, histone H3K27me3 deposition, H3K4me3 demethylation, histone deacetylation, inhibition of RNA Polymerase II transcription elongation or Ser-5 dephosphorylation. These proteins also silenced many other genes with different efficacy, and a machine learning model could accurately predict the efficacy of each silencer based on various chromatin features of the target loci. Furthermore, some proteins were also able to target gene silencing when used in a dCas9-SunTag system.

PRJNA899097	Conserved and plant-specific GCN5-containing complexes cooperate to regulate gene transcription and plant development [30d RNA-seq] (thale cress)	"Although a conserved SAGA complex containing the histone acetyltransferase GCN5 is known to mediate histone acetylation and transcriptional activation in eukaryotes, how to maintain different levels of histone acetylation and transcription at the whole-genome level remains to be determined. Here, we identify and characterize a plant-specific GCN5-containing complex, which we term PAGA, in Arabidopsis thaliana and Oryzae sativa. In Arabidopsis, the PAGA complex consists of two conserved subunits (GCN5 and ADA2A) and four plant-specific subunits (SPC, ING1, SDRL, and EAF6). Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing indicate that PAGA and SAGA have both shared and specific target genes, and independently mediate moderate and high levels of histone acetylation, thereby promoting moderately and highly transcriptional activation, respectively. By combining RNA-seq and ChIP-seq data, we found that PAGA and SAGA antagonistically regulate histone acetylation and gene transcription. Genetically, PAGA mutations can partially rescue the developmental defects of the SAGA-specific mutant ada2b-c. Unlike SAGA, which regulates multiple biological processes, PAGA is specifically involved in plant height and branch growth by regulating the transcription of hormone biosynthesis and response related genes. These results reveal how PAGA and SAGA cooperate to regulate histone acetylation, transcription, and development. Given that the PAGA mutants show semi-dwarf and increased branching phenotypes without reduction in seed yield, the PAGA mutations could potentially be used for crop improvement.
